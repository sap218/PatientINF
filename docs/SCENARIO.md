Inflammation is...

## What we found out...

Come back soon when manuscript is accepted!

**Note**: you can recreate our methods as all data files are provided in the [GitHub](https://github.com/sap218/patientFORUM) except the forums of interest `JSON` due to data being too large. We used the CaStLeS Bear services at University of Birmingham [7] to extract forum, and perform majority of analysis.

*The computations described in this paper were performed using the University of Birmingham's BlueBEAR HPC service, which provides a High Performance Computing service to the University's research community. See `http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/bear` for more details.*
