            "post": "Hi All\r\n\r\nBeen a while I stop updating my epi scleritis condition.  I am  on remission since my last episode in May 2018.\r\n\r\nI am living with epi since 2013 with no underlying diseases.  I noticed my epi recur on the same left eye early this month.  Is distressing!  This time I use pred forte 4 x  a day, timolo maleate twice daily and arcoxia 90 mg twice daily.  Apart from this,  I am on supplements too.  I take nuvapine A 320 mg , grapeseed 15000 twice daily, ocumin ared eye vitamins, epo with fish oil and red yeast with CQ10. On the third day I can see the redness reduce significantly.   In my last bout, arcoxia 90 mg does not help.   I had to be on oral streoid therapy.   Possibly because of the supplements I take, arcoxia does help this time.   If can take turmeric as well.  Turmeric calm inflammation. I am sharing this hopefully those who are in same condition can give it a try.   As we know, epi has no cure, no prevention and no known cause.  Most ophtalmologists would prescribe oral steroid when all drugs fail.   Steroid is a powerful drug and it control your symtoms and do not heal.   Healing is left to your body's capacities.  Go natural with the right supplement and dose, it helps.\r\n\r\nI hope someone who battle epi tirelessly would find this sharing a relieve.   All the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I do not know if it is related and my GP will not commit to say it is but after Shingles I kept getting episcleritis.I tried Pred Forte which worked well at first but as my bouts of episcleritis increased i was told to stop using it as the pressures in my eyes increased. I then used Acular but it is not nearly as effective. I got steadily more fed up with looking like something out of a horror film 2 weeks out of each month so in despair went to see a nutritionist. She advised me that the episcleritis was a symptom of my immune system being damaged and put me on a course of Vitamin B, Omega 3 fish oil, a general multi vitamin and a pro biotic plus a daily dose of an anti oxidant supplement with vitamins A,C and E. Unless you are pregnant or wanting to be, I think this has made a difference as apaprt from one day of a vague redness (normally it wold last 10) I have not had a recurrence. It seems to be working so I wanted to share this with you. erhaps give it a go. Good luck.",

I've had it in the left eye for 5 weeks now and in the right for 2 weeks.  My left eye has a really intense red area and is now inflamed all over.  I'm not thrilled about the prospect of it recurring and am getting fed up with the questions and odd looks, let alone the discomfort.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if my body is telling me I need to get healthier and boost my immune system, so I'm very interested to read about your experiences and see what's helped.  I'll also let you know if I have any success with alternative treatments.",

The doctors have tried to treat it quite agressively as I have already lost my right eye due to glaucoma as a child. \r\n\r\nI have been treated with steroid drops for 3 months but everytime I stop using them the redness and pain immediately returns. It is very frustrating as I can't wear my contacts either whilst on the drops! I think I will try the nutrition advice and I'll let you know how I get on.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has anymore advice or tips about what is causing the condition (as none of the doctors have commented on this as yet) I'd be grateful to know.\r\n\r\nThanks",

                    "post": "Hello,\r\n\r\nRecently diagnosed with Episcleritis after a long struggle to get a diagnosis (doctors said variously pink eye, optical herpes, food allergies, washing powder allergies, quite confusing in general... ). I share the distress of the rest on the forum (having to go through a busy day in the office with a bloody eye kills the confidence completely, and it happens to me three or four times a month).\r\n\r\nI don't take treatment for it, but keen to look at herbal options now. I have no hard feeling for the linkages, but I have noticed over the past years some linkages:\r\n- food/intolerances. I often feel I get a very bad bout of epi after certain foods: kiwi, mango, soy, quorn, perhaps dairy. Now I had the allergy prick test which registered nothing, and the blood RAST test which showed very mild reactions (but hardly allergic). But still, I am fairly sure that just a few hours after eating kiwi, I get an inflammation, so perhaps it's affecting me at a level just not really picked up with the standard tests. I'm still playing with eliminating different things.\r\n- I often think there's a link to bowels - again, no 'evidence' (I should keep a diary) but I often get a bad stomach and epi outbreaks at a similar time. The bad stomach too might be related to intolerance, to be determined...\r\n- Stress, late night working, flights. Nothing worse for my eye than a tough deadline at work or a long flight.\r\n- Immune system. Yes, mine is poor (often having colds and sniffles), and after reading the posts above, it seems that I'd do well to try and boost this.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, hope this is useful to some, happy to see if rings a bell with anyone else. I'll pursue the immune boosting and trying to identify troublesome foods.\r\n\r\nDavid\u00a0",

After insurance it cost me $40. Well worth it. The pain goes away immediately. This has not cured my condition but has made it tolerable. Will be trying the above suggestions. I too have ulcers and feel it is related to my stomach. Everyone immediately tells me this can not be the case but reading all of the above comments I feel we are on to something. I hope this helps you all!!</p>",

                    "post": "<p>Hi Misty,</p><p>I have suffered with episleritis for about 10 years, since I turned 40. My episodes have worsened and lengthened. My current episode has lasted almost 9 months in my right eye. I have had all the blood tests going for underlying health issues and nothing has shown up. I have been managing it with Pred Forte drops and Acular (Acular has not been effective for me at all so I stopped using it). I recently saw a top opthamologist at great expense and even he could not give me any answers as to what causes my eye issue and what to do to stop it happening. I simply have to manage it with Pred Forte, which as other people on here have said, is sickening after a while and I hate using it but without it my eye just goes wild, bright red, watery and the pulling straining pain in my head is terrible.. .All very depressing, undermining my self esteem and generally making me so frustrated every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. So....having read your suggestion about orange juice and vitamin C, I was ready to give it a go. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I was seriously sceptical. This condition gets you down and the lack of answers make you feel hopeless. However, here I am 1 week on and my eye is virtually clear, just the last remnants of a pink shadow that you get when you come to the end of an episode. I am seriously so happy as for me, there is definitely something in your theory with the Vitamin C. So, I  started with drinking lots of o.j. then realised the sugar content and thought I may go over to taking high strength vitamin C capsules instead. I read the contraindications of taking a lot of vit C (diarrhea) but have not suffered from this however, I was prepared to go through this to see if my eye improved. I have eaten lots of oranges too. I take 2 x 1000mg vit C capsules a day. I eat 2 oranges a day and drink o.j. mixed with water as often as possible. I started to see an improvement after 3 days. When I saw the eye specialist earlier this year, I asked him if there was an allergy, deficiency etc and he pretty much laughed at me and said there was  no link. Well, I am pretty sure the deficiency has been vit C but you have to take a large dose to get this thing started on the road to improvement. Thank you for the great tip. If this continues to work I will post again. I will update my progress because if this is the answer and not just a fluke, it&#39;s pretty amazing for everyone out there with this debilitating condition. Fingers crossed here! </p>",

Now I am on Methotrexate since January.  No big improvement so far.  The thing I am grateful for is the fact that I have no pain at all and it is only in one eye.\r\n\r\nI do have a high sed rate but no other link to RA or lupus.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am very intrigued by the use of vitamin C.  I will start on the OJ ASAP.  I am wondering if anyone out there has had success with Posterior Scleritis and vitamin C.\r\n\r\nI also saw someone in this discussion mention gluten.  Is there a connection?\r\n\r\nThank you everyone!",

I have been taking vitamin C supplements and drinking orange juice daily since I read the post from Misty. I still have had flare ups but not as frequently. I have no idea if it's the vit. C or other things but I'm still going to take it. \r\n\r\nI'm glad your pain is gone and I hope you find what you need to go into full remission.

I also have rheumatoid arthritis.  my rheumatologist and Opthomologist wanted me to take stronger biologics to control the inflammation but I didn't want to go that route  so I sought a naturalpathic doctor to see if he could help.  He did some research and  discovered that sulfites can cause eye inflammation.  So he put me on a no sulfite diet for two weeks and then had me add back foods containing sulfites to see my reaction.  i do have a sulfite sensitivity and have to avoid certain  foods.  once i did that my scleritis improved greatly to the point that my eye doctor said there was no trace of scleritis.   needless to say this is not a cure  all  i do have to watch what i eat.  i hope my experience helps others suffering from scleritis.  Sulfites are found naturally in foods (garlic, onions, cauliflower, etc)  and added in frozen foods, wine and coffee .  I've gone organic and also read food labels to make sure i avoid it as much as possible. ",

I got this maybe about 7 years ago and I remember someone saying it was 'catching'. I moved from the Uk to Dubai and the sand and dust were just the worst aggravating my eyes even more.  I tried an opthalmologist who insisted it was dry eyes. I then went somewhere else and they diagnosed this correctly.  I was given the steroid drops etc..... It still kept coming back! so I went back and the eye doctor confirmed its a skin problem and then explained its a collagen issue.  I saw this thread and did some research and thought it can't hurt and started taking high dose vitamin c.  My eyes are 90% better now and there are no nodules.  Sometimes I can have a small flare up interestingly when I have had stomach acid. If I do have a small flare up then the steroid drops just calm the anger now but its only small.  I wanted to wait a couple of months before I wrote this because its a time will tell thing! However, nothing else has changed apart from the vitamin c.  I really hope that this helps someone out there\r\n\r\n",

Of course there are other immune suppressant medicine your eye doctor might recommend but so far steroid work best.   \r\nI am not aware initially that episcleritis has no known cure.  Steroid can only put you in remission.  My left eye redness almost gone. \r\nI still need to follow up eye exam with my dr.  He will then decide to put me off steroid and eye drop altogether.  \r\nI am all this while taking supplements for my eye.  I even wash my eyelid with eyelid wipes day and night. I do all it takes looking after my eyes good.  Yet i still get epi.  Worse is you never know when the next flare up going to be.  No prevention.  I am not here to scare you but is happening to me.  Aahh!  I am sad.\r\nI hope your condition is not serious.  Everyone is different.   All the very best to you.  Take care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I suppose the worst is the insomnia, sweating &amp; weight gain.  Along with menopause, it wasn&#39;t pleasant. I was always very thin and I&#39;m now 40-50 lbs over my normal weight. Being overweight and hot, in Florida isn&#39;t a good combo. Trying to lose weight is difficult.</p><p>I know I sound depressing, but keep in mind I have scleritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They say eppi is not as serious. So I hope yours doesn&#39;t turn into full blown scleritis! And no other deseases associated with it. I&#39;d get bloodwork to rull out other deseases. Although sometimes it doesn&#39;t show its ugly face until later, and sometimes doesn&#39;t show in bloodwork. If you can get ahead of it early on is good. Can prevent lots of damage esp in the joints. But that&#39;s the worse case scenario. So you&#39;re doing ok now in comparison to the more serious forms. It also depends a lot on how bad your pain is?</p><p>I hope to keep in touch and hear nothing but future good news from you! I know I sound like a downer, but please don&#39;t let that scare you. I was an optician for many years, sold thousands of eyeglasses and I&#39;ve only met ONE woman who had scleritis as bad as mine. I know there&#39;s many case studies of it, but most are much more benign. </p><p>Oh, and I went to quite a few doctors before I got the correct diagnosis from Bascom Palmer Institute. I was so bad that the first thing they did (30 years ago)  was the injections in both eyes. So I highly recommend 2 or more doctor opinions and only the best!</p><p>Healthy and happy wishes to you and best of luck!! &#128522;</p>",

Every each time I was asked to do systemic blood test, chest x ray and Mantoux test. This is to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, sle, etc. Each time results are negative. This time i was asked to do sarcoidosis and anca test.  Like you this is my fifth ophthalmologist sub specialty in inflammatory diseases.  Hope he can help my epi.\r\n\r\nIt always my left eye that is effected.  It is epi. Nodular type and sectoral.  No it does not progress to scleritis. Mine have no pain. Mild discomfort, watery, redness, and photophobia.  Good thing is i am not associated with others disease.  \r\n\r\nI am in the fifth decade of life and post menopausal.  I am on 20mg prednisone now. I feel less of the side effect.   I watch my diet.  Yes, I exercise a lot.   At least 3.5 hrs cardio, hit, abs and strength training mix per day.  \r\n\r\nI am from Kuala Lumpur. Sunny all year round.  I am schedule to follow up vis it for eye check next Monday. Will keep you posted the progress.\r\n\r\nHope all are well with you. Stay healthy!"

I was on prednisone for almost a year but as much as the prednisone use conquers the pain it also does other horrible things to your body. Bone loss is one of the most significant things about prolonged pred use. My eye doctor was insistent I get off of it and my bone density proved the effects of prednisone. Believe me if prednisone did not have such significant side effects I would still be on it. Also, when you decide to get off of prednisone it takes a long time of tapering. It took me six months but now I can sleep through the night again, those mood swings are gone and I don&#39;t have fear of the internal damage it does.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I wish you luck and patience because it has been a test for me.

I have been on methotrexate and cellcept, both made me horribly sick and I ended up in the hospital multiple times with pneumonia. I&#39;ve tried the pred eye drops but posterior scleritis is in the back of the eye and it doesn&#39;t reach it. And I&#39;ve gotten steroid injections into my eyeball, and that was just horrible, painful, and did nothing. Everytime I cut down on prednisone lower than 6mg a day, it flairs up very badly. I end up having to go up to 35 or 40mg just to calm it down. The flairs have also caused 1/4 of my vision loss in my left eye. I just wish I had more options. I&#39;m very happy to hear that the chemo and remecade infusions are working for you.  Do you have posterior, or anterior scleritis? And have they found any other medical problems that could be the cause of the disease in you? Cause they have been running tests on me for 9 years and can&#39;t find anything else wrong, but tell me it&#39;s normally secondary to another disease or disorder... </p>"

My third opinion dr said he couldn\u2019t help me anymore and that I may want to get a second opinion [b]\u2014[/b] I should have reminded him that he was my third opinion but whatever. So my protocol at this point is prednisone drops 3-4 x per day and 30 mg per dropper full of [b]CBD OIL[/b] TINCTURE UNDER MY TONGUE 4 x a day. I\u2019ve also added a CBD WITH THC cream to put on my face to quiet the pain and it\u2019s helping. Do not get CBD tincture with alcohol in it as it tastes terrible and burns when u put under tongue and it will add more misery to ur situation. You can buy high-end CBD products over the counter at a dispensary, but I would get ur medical [b]marijuana[/b] license as a backup incase the CBD without THC doesn\u2019t work then you can purchase the one with THC in it but you will need the license to do that. It takes about a month of faithfully using the [b]CBD OIL[/b] for it to kick in. I\u2019m happy with results so far. I\u2019m taking myself out of the mainstream medical protocol cuz it ruins the rest of ur body and I am otherwise healthy at 61.</p>",

There is a vasculitis UK support group on facebook (Scleritis comes under the vasculitis auto immune heading) but I find that those members are suffering from far worse than scleritis (yes there are worse things) and really frightened me when I first joined. Have you seen a rheumatologist? Last time I went to the ophthalmology clinic they decided to refer me back to Manchester Eye Hospital as they are at a loss how to treat me.</p><p>Best wishes :-)&#160;</p>",

You can take Bi weekly to Weekly shots. Also have you talked to your doctor about taking an Anti Depressant medication? I too started feeling very depressed and the fact that this illness/other medications are making you feel [b]suicidal[/b] is really awful. There are other medication out there to counter act that until you get your eye disease under&#160;control. &#160;I think we all get that there are worse things in life. But S**t is s**t and right now what we have is a form of s**t. So either way you put it it sucks. But that doesn&#39;t mean there is not a&#160;positive outcome. There are other medications out there that don&#39;t have to be steroids. There is also Remicade infusions. I may actually start those in about 2 weeks. We will see. So press your doctors about getting you off the steroids and onto something you can tolerate better. Hang in there!!! It really is hard. I understand.</p>",

My ophthamologist was insistent on me getting off of prednisone because of the side effects you speak of and the bone loss that occurs. Unfortunately, it took time for me to get into see the RA doctor to get the drugs to replace prednisone. At one point, I would have rather died than endured the pain. Finally, I went to my primary care doctor because my retinal specialist listened to my plea of pain and told me scleritis pain is constant, it doesn&#39;t come and go. My primary care doctor looked up my nose and told me I was completely full of congestion. She gave me decongestant and told me to get flonase spray. I no longer have to take 3200 mg of advil along with prednisone and company and am pain free. Crazy, right!</p><p></p><p>It takes time to find the right cocktail that will clear the scleritis. Your body attacking itself is hard to cope with but try to find other outlets to help you through it. I found a place that is affordable and have begun weekly accupucture.

It was brutal for the first year or so, then I found a great rheumologist and a combination of drugs that, for the most part keep it under control. I take 7 mg of prednisone, methotrexate and Humira. Unfortunately every time I try to ween off of the prednisone I go into a flare. So, much to my dismay, I take them faithfully. I too have never heard of anyone losing an eye. Modern medicine is very helpful and they are constantly working on new meds to keep us going incase our current meds stop working. Usually there is an underlying issue that hasn\u2019t presented itself. \u00a0Mine is Crohns. If they find your underlying issue it may help them find the best \u201ccocktail\u201d to keep you in remission. Best wishes to you.",

I have finally found an eye drop that helps after trying every one out there practically. Its calle Lotemax. Good luck getting your insurance to cover it mine wont but its worth the 200$ trust me! I am also on Prednesone but slowly tapering been on high does of that for 2 months. The side effects are just horrible. Started Methotrexate a month and a half ago but had to up the dosage as my eyes have hit a spot where they are not getting worse, But not getting better. Since the goal is remission My Dr. said I may need to take Humera with the Methotrexate. So fingers crossed this puts me into remmision. THe only problem is &#160;i feel ike sh*t a lot of the time. Super low energy, Out of breath. But my hope is once in remisson I can take a lower dose of stuff. Is anyone esle on a cocktail of drugs that have put them into remission? Also fun not so funny fact. Our eye dease is so rare only 10 thousand people in the world are diagnosed with it a year. Guess we are just that special!!!</p>",

But I have found that stress triggers your eye to get worse. February 16th is not far away. But I know it feels like a lifetime. Is there any way for you to call or have a parent call for you to get an earlier appointment. You will need to see 2 doctors. You will need to see a Ophthalmologist and a Rheumatologist. Seeing these two doctors will be key to your recovery/maintenance of your eye disease.\u00a0 Even though there is no cure there is treatment to make living with this manageable. I have good and bad days but more good than bad now. I have now been diagnosed for a bit over a year. Be prepared for this next year to be quite a journey for you. Depression is a very\u00a0 high side effect of a chronic illness. Try to make an appointment to see your primary care doctor about possibly getting on anti depressants until you figure all of this out. Because feeling depressed is going to make your life so much harder. I honestly know this is scary and depressing and angering. But you will be ok. You are young and otherwise healthy. You will be ok!! You can message me anytime. I know what you are going through and I am a mom and my heart goes out to you. If there is anything I can do to help support you through this please let me know.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSmiles\r\nShauna\u00a0"

I know we are strangers but I really am here for you. I had to try over 10 eye drops till I found some that actually started helping.&#160;</p><p></p><p>?May I ask what country you live in? I want to do some research about what options you have.&#160;</p><p></p><p>?Because you do not have family or friends that seem to understand what you are going threw I think it would be extremely helpful for you to see a therapist until you get a manage on everything. Also Anti depressants.&#160;</p><p></p><p>?Unfortunately there is no cure for what we have. But there is remission/management. Like I said you will have good days and bad days. Right now you are having a bad Flair. You will need to figure out with your team of doctors what you need to start doing.&#160;</p><p></p><p>?If you would like you can private message me and I can give you my personal e mail address? This way I can send you more specific things you need to start saying and doing to advocate for yourself. You will need to do this. It is crucial you find doctors that you feel are supportive and taking you seriously. You should be getting eye checks every 2 weeks at this point. From and Ophthalmologist.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Questions?</p><p>?Do you have an Ophthalmologist?</p><p>?Do you have a Rheumatologist?</p><p>?Do you have a primary care doctor?</p><p></p><p>?If you don&#39;t please spend this next week setting up those doctor appointments for yourself.&#160;</p><p></p><p>?You will need all 3 and preferably ones that will communicate with each other. If not that is also ok just make sure you keep them updated.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Hang in there and I know you cant imagine but in a year from now things will be better for you. It is a long journey so buckle up. I am here to help you in any way I can. I really can understand what it is like.

In addition to the eye specialists and RA doctor I have locally, I go to an eye specialist at Duke University.

Once you get to the dosage of prednisone that eases the pain; your RA doctor will get you on a dosage of other things like methotrexate and humira or remicade...depending on your inflammation markers.&#160;Once they kick in, you can ease of the prednisone-make sure you don&#39;t go off oral prednisone without tapering or you will be in big trouble.&#160; It took me a year to get off that stuff, I hate it but in case you have something called a flare you will need the prednisone again.</p><p></p><p>I am &#160;going on 2 years of navigating this stuff.

What my research specialist told me was try to tolerate the methotrexate because each time I change the drugs because I can&#39;t tolerate them, I am getting more adverse side affects. I take remicade infusions and methotrexate. I continue to have the scleritis but it is no worse. Of course the goal is to not have any signs of it because the fear is the sclera melting.

He said that isn&#39;t the scleritis check with your primary care doctor. I did and I my nasal cavity was filled with mucas. I didn&#39;t even consider it but I&#160; took mucinex d and no more pain.

            "post": "<p>This forum is great! The ability to express your pain and for it to be understood and acknowledged helps me beyond measure. In my experience, this disease, is not only painfully debilitating, it is emotionally exhausting. The advice and experiences within bring hope where hope is often hard to find!</p><p></p><p>One year and two months ago, I went to get contacts. Within a month, my eyes were beet red and I was in the pain we all know too well. Six months later, my diagnoses was anterior and posterior scleritis. Like all of us, it has been a long journey. I finally found an eye specialist in my area who could properly diagnose me. He believes it is scleritis rooted in RA. What he then did was form a team. He found a retinal specialist for me at Duke University and made an appointment with a rheumatologist who could prescribe and monitor the endless drugs they try out on us Guinea pigs.</p><p></p><p>Of course, like all of us, I have been on varying amounts of prednisone since the onset of this journey. Yes, I too, am thankful for the pain relief but consider it a demon the longer you are on it: bone loss, mood swings, [b]suicidal[/b] thoughts, cannot sleep, night sweats, and the list goes on.</p><p></p><p>January: I began taking 3200mg of Advil to try to alleviate the pain. It never alleviated all of it but I could function. I took and continue to take predlisone drops and comagan drops to relief the pressure built up from the predlisone drops</p><p></p><p>March: Under the supervision of a rheumatologist, I began 15 mg (6 pills) of methotrexate taken weekly and folic acid daily, while still trying to taper off prednisone.</p><p></p><p>May: Humira was added, first every other week, then weekly.</p><p></p><p>If you think the scleritis is bad, add all over head pain in addition to the pain behind your eye and on the bridge of your nose, swollen feet, and waking up every two hours to get a drink of water for dry mouth. I would hold my head at night and cry until I could cry no longer. I equate all those side effects to Humira.</p><p></p><p>Last month, I went to Duke University in Durham, NC for a follow up appointment. A doctor, who is an associate of my specialist examined my eyes and remarked about how dry they are. She asked me to get over the counter eye drops for dry eye, without preservative, and to put them in my eye every two hours.</p><p></p><p>At this point, I am willing to try almost anything.</p><p>So\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p></p><p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I do the dry eye drops but sometimes I forget. I found, on Amazon, a mask that heats up and is for dry eye. I do this morning and night for 30 minutes. I know it feels amazing and I think it is helping. I have been doing this for two weeks.</p><p></p><p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I have been going to an Acupuncturist for about 2 months.</p><p></p><p>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2 weeks ago, I began [b]oil pulling[/b] which is a process of swishing coconut oil in your mouths to rid any hidden bacteria or infection that may be present in my gums. Google \u2018[b]oil pulling[/b].\u2019 I hate doing it, but in the light of the alternative of scleritis, I will do it.</p><p></p><p>Here is where it gets good:</p><p></p><p>Last Friday, I decided my quality of life was of no quality and I did not give myself the Humira shot.</p><p></p><p>Saturday, I woke up and I was a new person. It was astonishing and very unexpected. I had no head pain and no swelling in my feet. By Sunday, I slept through the night without the exhaustion of dry mouth. I have reduced my prednisone to 2.5 every other day. By Monday, I felt no need to take the Advil first thing in the morning. For eight months, I have not been able to begin my day without a cocktail of prednisone and 800mg of Advil.</p><p></p><p>I asked my doctor if she would consider me going off the Humira until my next bloodwork tells the tale of my inflammation. She believes this is simply a fluke and that the Humira finally kicked in. She believes that if I stop taking the Humira, my scleirtis will get worse.</p><p></p><p>For now, I am going to wait and see how I feel. Neither of my choices are good if indeed she is correct. Go blind or live a life that is not worth living on Humira.</p><p></p><p>My advice to everyone is to think outside the box. You know your body better than anyone else. Think about any possible cause and try things. If I had to do it over again, I would try adding one thing at a time so I would know what indeed is working. However, like all of us, I was desperate for relief.</p><p></p><p>Please pray for me that this works!&#160; &#160;</p><p></p><p>Update: I went to the acupuncturist yesterday. My regular person is on vacation so I was with the person who started the clinic. She told me that eye is a reflection of what is happening in the liver and the liver is where we store anger that is not released. I thought this very interesting. She gave me chinese herbal medicine to get &quot;the fire&quot; out of my eyes.</p><p></p><p>Good luck to all!</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p>",

I also have what I describe as little bursts of pain behind my eye, like little explosions. Sometimes I feel as if a knife is going through my eye over and over. As quickly as they come, they go. My doctor at Duke says the pain that comes and goes is not from the scleritis and I should consult my primary care doctor. It doesn&#39;t seem possible as severe as it is that it is not from the scleritis. Does anyone else experience this kind of pain?</p>",

What medication do they have you on?\r\nRight now I am taking Methotrexate and Weekly Humira shots. After starting weekly Humira shots I am completely pain free. My eyes are still red but not as severe. I am not in remission but being pain free is amazing. If you are not taking Humira start talking to your doctor about it. It took me over a month to get my insurance to approve it. They also have a savings card you can apply for so that your co pay will not be over 5 dollars.\r\n\r\nSmiles\r\nShauna",

I know it feels uncomfortable but your life and health matter. Even if they are treating you otherwise.\r\nI did have one really weird side effect from Humira. I lost my voice for 4 hours\u00a0the 2nd shot I gave myself. I looked it up and that happens to 20% of people who take it. It only happens on the second shot and it was just really weird. I talked to my Dr. About it but other than that and the fact its the most painful injection ever. No I have not had any terrible side effects. But people who can tolerate Methotrexate should stay on that because its considered the gold standard drug. If your specialist wants you to\u00a0up it for sure you should!\r\n\r\nI am really upset you have been treated this way. and your Rheumatologist should see you Monthly until you are pain free.

I am on 7mg of prednisone daily, 20ml of methotrexate weekly and 40ml of Humira bi-weekly. &#160;This &quot;cocktail&quot; has worked well for me for 4 or 5 years now. &#160;I honestly forget how long I&#39;ve been on all three. &#160;The years seem to all flow together. &#160;As Shauna mentioned every indiviual is different with scleritis, there is no one &quot;cure all&quot;, which is really upsetting. &#160;I feel like a science experiment. &#160;I absolutely agree with Shauna, you are your own best advocate, you need to try to find a different Rheumatologist. &#160;One that you will be able to see more often. &#160;Even if you have to drive an hour or two, it will be worth it. &#160;This has been a long, tiring, emotional journey for me. &#160;When I was first diagnosed I had no idea I would be dealing with it 8 years later. &#160;You need to have a doctor who will be there for you emotionally as well. &#160;The psychological affect of being on such strong medication and being unable to control the situation has been very difficult for me. &#160;My doctor has been there through every tear, every anger filled conversation and has tried to answer every &quot;what if &quot; question I have thrown his way. &#160;Please try to find a doctor who will be there for you. &#160;It will make your journey a little easier. &#160;Good luck and best wishes.</p>",

Early on my road with scleritis they gave me predlisone (which is a steroid drop); because the steroid brings the pressure up in your eyes, they gave me comagan to control that. Scleritis needs more powerful drugs to clear because it is my understanding that it&#160;occurs due to an underlying autoimmune disease. I had to take oral prednisone to control the pain until I could get into a rheumatologist. I faced lots and lots of tests and had to have patience and after a year and a half, I am beginning to find relief. I would highly recommend feeding your soul as you venture down this road. I recently found Oprah&#39;s SuperSoul Converstations and listen to them. I wish you well!</p><p>pamela elle</p>"

Any way i have been under the hospital for 4 years always back and fourth. I have various types of treatments (Steroids oral and aziathropine and more) The only thing that kind of helped patch it over, was a steroid injection in the cheek and eye lid. In a result over the course of time, i had over 10 injections and put on 4 stone from being on steroids. I then had to have an operation to remove the fat which had stored from these injections. I have reoccuring attacks which can ladt weeks at a time My eye is never white, I have also lost most of my sight in my right eye. I have never had problems with my left eye, up untill Dec 2008. What makes it soo much harder is its now in both eye's and when its up it's so painfull, I am really struggling i can't leave the house and my job is getting harder and harder to maintain now. I feel their is not enough awarness for patient's any type of scleritis. I know when some makes a comment on my eye's or ask what it is. When you tell them they have no idea.",

Opthalmologist referred me to an eye specialist,who increased my dosage of Durezol,but redness still persisted, I was referred to an RA. A lot of bloodworks which are all normal. Rx Prednisone,metjotrexate,folic acid,meloxicam, for eyedrops still on Durezol, Prolenza and Combigan. With all these, still having eye issues daily specially in the morning. Seems need to increase dosage of steroids again. But starting to feel the bad side effects of all meds. Having blurry vision with left eye now, weight gain, cramps, losing hair,hot flushes etc all fr the steroids. Eye specialist just told me, they have not found treatment but just controlling the scleritis symptoms, which made me feel so low. Now I deal with it on a day-to-day basis.

Ok, it tastes like you're drinking compost, but I'm really sure that it does help.  Actually I read lately in the Readers Digest that green tea is good for your eyes so maybe I'm not imagining it. The stuff I'm using is Asda's own decaffinated green tea and when I wake up with that familiar feeling that means I've got a red eye I drink several cups, by dinner time the redness is fading and by night it's gone altogether.  Thing is I want someone else to try it now, just to see if it's a fluke or not. Hey, if it doesn't help, it won't harm (except for the taste!!!) and it's got to be better than the nasty chemicals that the doctor has to offer!\r\nPlease someone try it and let me know.\r\nMusic maker",

Don,t want to sound like a put-down and I know every little helps but those of us that have scleritis cannot be likened to the condition of episcleritis .  The former being connected to a underlying  systemic condition. The other being more of a surface condition . Having said that I am not minimising the condition ! [I know it is painful!. )Green tea has many good health properties and is a good addition to any diet. However more is needed to treat scleritis (see previous posts)  Now to bring you up to date with my recent news. I have not had a major flare up for months!!!  I am now entering the menopausal phase of my life, not a pleasnt experience but no periods = no flare ups ! I have long thought my scleritis was connected to hormone changes (see previous posts)I think this might be the case.  I know this revelation won,t be helpful to many of you but I feel like I no longer have the life sentance called scleritis. At last after many years of absolute agony and dispair  I can start living again !  I have had pain but I take my prescribed celebrex and relief follows. I will continue to keep in touch, I hope my respite from scleritis continues and I sincerely hope you all find relief from this little known but awful condition!!!",

It was anterior diffuse. In Feb this year I had another bout in my left eye, followed by another attack in my right eye just over a month ago.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0I find I'm spending quite a bit of time researching scleritis and what it might mean for me in the future. The only problem is I'm finding no good news stories, but I guess they don't feel the need to discuss it when it's going well.\r\nI have found a lovely support group on facebook, there are only 2 so easy to find ;)\u00a0\r\nI've just finished a 5 week course of prednsilone, but am still getting nasty headaches and pain around my eye socket, so I think there might be some residual inflammation this time.\r\nI had the same genetic test done, but mine was negative, however I do have a lot of the Ankylosing spondylitis symptoms, so the rheumatologists/opthamologists are keeping an eye on me. I have a lot of other health problems and it's hard to try and juggle all the info and symptoms and try and work out what is doing what. It's a nightmare lol.\r\nHave your symptoms settled at all in the 8 month period? Did the steroids reduce the inflammation initially? I think I'm pretty lucky that they have worked well for me so far.\r\nThe consultant I saw said the next time I have a bout they will be putting me on an autoimmune drug like Methotrexate, to see if they can prevent it from reoccurring. Fingers crossed I won't need it\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you Dawn, feel free to PM me if you want to chat\r\n\r\nSarah\r\n\u00a0",

When growing up I had these enormous pains with blood shot eyes but no doctor would treat it. The first time I was admitted to the Eye Center of Helsinki i was 20. They wanted me to try Prednisolon for couple of months, when it didn't work they sent me away. They said only that maybe I was mentally ill and stressed. Obviously I was angry and shocked because I am perfectly fine in my head, my only problem is my eyes.\r\n\r\nThen scleritis attacked my both eyes, first left and then right. It hurted so bad that I couldn't go to school, watch tv or anything else. I stayed up for three nights before I went to the ER. They sent me to the Eye Center.\r\n\r\nI was put on 70mg of Prednisolon, Pred Forte drops, Acular Allergan drops and 2300mg daily dose of painkillers. Prednisolon gave me chills, hallusinations and all kinds of side effects but I kept eating it. Cleritis was cured and the head doctor at EC (Who took me as his patient because no one has seen case like this) suggested I must continue the steroids. I continued and fight against side effects, bruises, dyspepsia, mood changes...Medication seemed to work and now after a year I tried finally drop the dose in 5mg (The amount of Prednisolon has been modified lower many times) but now within a week my boh eyes flared back bright red. And now the dosage of Prednisolon is again 30mg.\r\n\r\nThe worrying part is that my eye pressure has gone up over 30 wich is waaaaaay too high. So if anyone has any information about successful treatment without corticosteroids involved please let me know. I have been tested for any rheumatic diseases and all of the tests were negative.\r\n\r\nI would like to be a normal guy with normal things to do but the truth is this condition has and will ruin my life if it continues. I think the next step will be trying metothrexate but I'm really not into that kind of poisons, especially when I don't have any other symptomps of any rheumatic disease.\r\n\r\nKeep on fighting!\r\nLuca",

I am in Canada and I have seen every single eye specialist in my city. I think they are tired of all telling me the same thing. My eye starte just going red about once every six months or so back when I was 18.. then gradually became every 3 months, now it is every month. Ive been on the prednisone drops and now I am on Maxidex which to me seem like a huge waste of time. It doesn't do anything, maybe settles the pain a little. I am on the Maxidex without the anitbiotics. My eyes are sometimes red at the same time but more often it is my right eye and it can be more severe at times and last 10 days or so. I find that if I am really busy with work or have stress in my life it seems to come on stronger. I also notice that it is almost intime with my period. the day my period starts the eye issue starts.. I have been told so many things. I just don't know anymore. My mother has Lupus which I see on this site episcleritis is a sympton of... pleaseee someone has to know more about treatment options for this. I need to find a researcher.. I will do anything to have this go away forever :(",

I was diagnosed with [b:1629d06e40]scleritis[/b:1629d06e40] in 2002 after many years of pain and generally feeling rubbish!  I  believe the a viral ear infection I had in my early 20s(I am now 52) is responsable. I have never read that episclerits  is in any way linked to outside factors i.e. a scratch or wind but possible as it is inflamation of the episclera. With scleritis the deeper muscular part of the eye is affected resulting in extreme pain with movement of the eye At other times when the inflamation is nearer the surface the pain is increased by  light, either natural or artificial.On these occations 'normal' every day tasks are a nightmare because all you want to do is close your eyes! When the 'whites' of my eyes are red people symapthize or make comments like the ones already mentioned, but the time when i am in the most pain is when it is affecting the parts you can,t see where the brow bone or cheek bone is causing unbearable pain because of the pressure on the affected area. The pain also radiates through the face into the nerves of your teeth I could go on but i think you get the picture.  There is no cure ,there is very little support, there are different schools of thought - all adding to the frustration of an already ,as said, horid condition! My advice- find out as much info as you can &amp; then educate as many others as you can. I have lived with this condition for many years, not Knowing what was happening to me ! not being able to explain even to my family! Suffering in silence and solitude  not wanting to die but wanting relief!!   I am so pleased to have found others that feel the same ! that i am not a freak or a hypochondriac! Just someone trying to live their life the best way I can.       I have been able to write this much because for the first time in ,I can,t remember when, I have had no pain for 13 days !!! hope it lasts !!  regards to you all   KR",

When I do get my flare-up's they last around a week still & I have the nodular little bump but only feel slightly achey & I live happily with it.\r\nThe other year when I was diagnosed, and was told absolutely nothing by the hospital other than \"there's no cure, take steroids but they may hatharm your eyes!\" I thought that really wasn't acceptable so I trawled the internet looking for help and a lady popped up on one of these forums saying she had cut out all forms of gluten in her diet and is managing the condition fine now. She said it takes a couple of months to properly get out of your system but it really does work. I figured I'd try anything so gave this a shot and to my surprise, it really did work! Cutting out gluten is actually easier than you think, just can be quite expensive if you buy the breads & \"free from\" foods but I just cut down on those things and eat roasyroast dinner style meals and curries with rice instead of pasta dishes, etc. \r\nI take diclofenac's for a back condition where I broke my coccyx when I was 14 and it healed badly and from reading all the comments i'm now wondering if it could be that which has set the episcleritis off. I always thought it was probably UV light as i'm a big sun worshipper and used sunbeds as well (without goggles) but the hospital told me it shouldn't be that.\r\nAnyway, best of luck to you all and hope this helps. Take care,\r\nSarah. xx",

Did many many tests, none that were conclusive of the cause. As of now, i see an ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist to test me. so far I've been on predforte 1% drops along with some pain killers and now I've been started on Steroid tablets for a little more than a month tapering the tablets and the drops. The condition gets better once I'm on meds but it keeps recurring. The immunologist says i definitely have immunological scleritis and he suggests that i start on Folitray (immunosuppressant) and also to take Folivite to make up for the lost folic acid. I'm a bit hesitant to get on that. Please let me know if you have gone through anything of this sort. Looking for as many opinions as possible. REALLY SCARED.",

Given steroid eyedrops for much longer than I should by family doctor. Eventually took myself to see an optometrist - immediately sent to ophthalmologist who ordered CT scan and MRI - both normal. Starting to develop awful headaches around the left eye also. Eventually went to dentist, had a root canal, headaches cleared up and red eye went away. So forgot about it.\r\n\r\n4 years later, symptoms returned in left eye. This time headaches much more severe, waking me up at night. Went to MD, who did nothing. Eventually saw neurologist (arranged by myself through contacts) who said it was cluster headaches, gave me verapamil. Headaches worsened, neurologist couldn't see me for another year. After really severe headache went to ER. They thought I had temporal arteritis, had biopsy - normal. Referred to rheumatologist, lots of bloodwork - other than elevated ESR, bloodwork normal. Put on prednisone in ER, but when biopsy normal tapered off. Headaches stopped with prednisone. It was great for a while. Sent to see another neurologist - she also said cluster headaches but wanted me to see an eye doctor because of the red eye. Eye doctor said scleritis not cluster headaches. Put me on longer course of prednisone. Meanwhile red eye and headaches stopped in left eye, but came back in right eye. Prednisone cured all, but only at high doses. Symptoms returned when down to 20 mg. Sent back to another rheumatologist, now taking methotrexate and prednisone. Feel that I am a bit of a drug experiment. Neurologists still insist I have cluster headaches, eye doctors say no, it's scleritis. It is certainly a very frustrating and worrisome experience.\r\n[/b:d20797b321]",

It's really depressing.\r\n\r\nHaving read through all the topics, I don't know if I should feel \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; or not, for only having Episcleritis and not the more serious scleritis, etc.\r\nStill, I've been suffering for the last 3 years or so, inflammation in one or both eyes, almost every other week, and it keeps coming back. \r\n\r\nI've gone through a box of flurbiprofen tablets (non-steroid) which would reduce the pain but give me upset stomach (after 3 or more tablets).\r\n\r\nI was then given Prednisolone 0.1% steroid eye drops, which were awful, causing a weird yellow/green fluid to come out of the eye, while not reducing inflammation or pain. Stopped using them after few days...\r\n\r\nAnother eye clinic then prescribed the Acular eye drops (ketorolac trometamol 0.5%). These do seem to help with the pain a little bit, but the redness still remains for 5 to 6 days. \r\n\r\nAnd people still ask [i:9bc413c539]\\&quot;what's wrong with your eye?\\&quot; [/i:9bc413c539]as well as the usual ignorance of [i:9bc413c539]\\&quot;Ooh you've got conjunctivitis, I better stay away from you 'cause I might catch it!\\&quot;[/i:9bc413c539] That really infuriates me.  :evil: \r\n\r\nThese days I don't bother with the eye drops, but usually take a couple of Nurofen+ tablets, which does help to kill the pain. But the social problems are really depressing. I thought my job being stressful was a possible cause, but being off work hasn't helped. I don't feel like I can go out like a normal person and socialise, as most people give you funny looks or stupid comments. Knowing that this condition is apparently incurable and will keep coming back really gets me down. One positive aspect is that it shouldn't get worse and cause vision preoblems. Well I hope it won't.\r\n\r\nI would really like to hear from more of you with similar problems, and find out how you cope with them. It would help a lot. If episcleritis is as common as they say, then there must be lots of people out there who will have something say. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

I was on vacation with husband and friends and ended up going to Urgent care (I am in the US and these are clinics open at odd hours).  They sent me to an opthalmologist on call and he gave me eye drops.  \r\nCAUTION:  I am now seeing a great doctor at Stanford University......steroid eye drops increase your risk of glaucoma and cataracts.  You should not be taking them for more than a 10 day period.\r\nI have been responding well to large doses of ibuprofen, but again, after long term use (3 months, my stomach and GI do not feel well).  They have prescribed Nexium which helps prolong the negative side effects but I am aware that I am lucky because I haven't been put on oral steroids or immunosuppressants.....yet.\r\nMy case is what they consider mild, but I can't get it out of my mind.  Will I develop Rheumatoid arthritis?  Lupus?  Or worse.....\r\nIt is good to hear your stories because that let's me know that I won't necessarily develop those even though my eye is not well.  \r\nI just found out last night that is has moved to my other eye so it is in both eyes now.  The best comment I get from people is, \\&quot;you should go see another doctor, you probably just have something in your eye\\&quot;.  \r\nMy only concern is, should I be seeing a rheumatologist?  The opthalmologist says not yet and he is good, but you never know.\r\nIt is also good to hear someone say they quit work to relieve stress and it didn't help.  I keep re-thinking my job and will I have to put my family in a more difficult financial situation to relieve stress.  My doc said no, and it sounds like he is right.\r\nThanks for sharing!

We are a group of very frustrated people who only want someone to realy help us.  It never seems as though the doctors have any idea how we feel or have any idea how to calm our eyes down.  As I also have Sjogren and Lupus I know how difficult it is when we should have the benefit of departments working together to solve our problems, this seems quite impossible.  I feel for you younger people trying to make a living and am so thankful that my eyes didn't get so bad till I reached old age.  I can't think of any way to help except to say that I find heat is the only thing that helps.  I bathe my eyes every morning with baby shampoo in  slightly cooled boiled water, I sit with the shower onto my eyes until my face is numb and I heat wheat bags in the micowave and sit with them on my eyes.  Maybe someone else will tell us if they have any coping strategies.  Good luck to you all   kelsey",

                    "post": "I've had Scleritis for over 3 years and I think I've probably had every treatment possible.  Firstly I was given Pred Forte drops which worked for a couple of months, when it came back I was given Steriods on quite how doses with the intent to reduce the dose quite quickly.  But the Steroids again weren't enough.  After about 4 months of the steriods I was given an immunosuppressant (tacrolimus) to take as well.  For about a year this combination worked, although the scleritis still kept coming back it was manageable by altering the dosages.  In January last year, after having 3 servere outbreaks, another immunosuppressant was added to my treatment (azathioprine).  After again finding that the 3 treatments together were not enough, another treatment called Humira was added this was a TNF blocker in injection form.  However due to a very low immune system and high glucose (caused by the steriods and immunosuppressants) I ended up in Hospital.  I had a grion abcess that my body couldn't fight and when it turned into Necrotizing Fasciitis I was very ill indeed!  As soon as I went into hospital all treatments for the Scleritis was stopped apart from a small dose of steriods.  I had 2 surgeries, 4 weeks in hospital and 4 months off work.  It was 3 months before I had another bought of Scleritis.  I discussed treatments in great length with my optomitrist and we decided to just use the Humira injection and forgo any other treatments......I was Scleritis free for 6 months after that!!  It's not all good news tho, we recently tried to stop the treatment which has resulted in quite severe episodes of scleritis, but I have told my optomistrist that there is absolutely no way I will ever entertain steriods or immunosuppressants again....the risks are just too high.  It is a shame that I had to go through all of that to find out that the last treatment was the best one!!  I finally glad to find a post about Scleritis, I've never spoken to anyone else in the same boat as me.  Doesn't matter how much to try and explain how it feels, no one really understands how painful it can get.",

                    "post": "Hi, Just want to add my story.. I've been a long term sufferer of chronic iritis in both eyes, right though taking most of the brunt.  I'm a steroid responder so have been using Vexol (Rimexilone) throughout for treatment.  Then August 2008 suffered the worst pain imaginable.  Starting in right eye.  Along came severe eyebrow aches, eye twitching, horendous pain, worse pain with photosensitivity and inability to even look at a tv or a computer.  Spent 2 months bored, depressed and in severe pain.  I visited my usual eye hospital (which isn't a stones throw away from where I live) around 20 times from August to end of October.\r\nHad more blood tests done (which had already been done when I was first diagnosed with iritis 7 yrs ago). One came back an imbalance in thyroid, got that checked out with GP and now being treated for hypothyroidism. \r\n\r\nDuring this time the scleritis was diagnosed only after the 10th or so visit.  It then travelled into the left eye but was for a better term, less severe in pain that right, but still ruddy severe.\r\n\r\nI was given Optimmune eye ointment to take along with Arcoxia tablet (usually given for arthritis patients) which is NSAID (non steroid anti inflammatory drug).  Things started to calm down by the end of October but it's still there.\r\n\r\nMy eye lids and overall eye area has become very puffy and inflamed along with black circles under my lower lids.\r\n\r\nI am due a specialist visit on 14th November.  I have been told that injections of steroid may help and also talk of a CT Scan and other scans, oral steroids, but none actually been carried out as yet.  Ive been off work since August, then been made redundant to add insult to injury.\r\n\r\nDoc in casualty told me that after the diagnosis of thyroid imbalance things should start to settle - but I have my doubts.  Have a feeling that this is going to linger for a long time.  \r\n\r\nI must admit after reading some of the posts here, the heat treatment does help.  I either put hot compresses of cottonwool, hot towels on my eyes.  Also find that putting my face over a bowl of boiling water with a towel over everything for about 10 minutes also helps.\r\n\r\nI have spent a fortune on prescriptions over the years but more recently with this diagnosis of scleritis.  Before the scleritis was diagnosed I was given different steroid drops (without preserves - no luck), various types of dry eye treatment, around 30 boxes of different strengths of eye drops and tubes of lubricants too.\r\n\r\nI guess the only light at the end of this is that i now dont have to pay for prescriptions now I have thyroid problem - but boy that doesn't go anywhere near how elated I'd feel if I could just go back to life with normal eyes.\r\n\r\nI am looking for anyone else's tips on how to cope with this.  I cannot plan anything at the moment, not even a short break for me and my other half, as he has had the worst time too with this, seeing me in such a state and in pain.  I have until this week (3rd Nov) had to sleep upright during the night, not that I have had much sleep since this whole episode started.  I have not worn eye make up either, and have been out for 1 night out, yes, I had my 40th birthday to boot!  \r\n\r\nAnd they say life begins at 40!!!\r\n\r\nI'm still a youngster and a person who has a lot of work experience who doesn't want to sit idle, wants to use those skills and get back to work and a normal life.... Anyone, please help.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you\r\nMaria",

At first the episcleritis would appear sporadically, once or twice a year. Then it was every few months, then every few weeks. I have been on steroid eye drops for years but I think they just stopped working. \r\nAbout a year ago, the episcleritis changed and became scleritis. As you all know, the pain was unbearable and I didn't know what it was. It was affecting my job, my life because I just didn't know how to deal with the pain. My General Practioner even gave me percocets but that didn't help. When it changed to scleritis, my eye doctor put me on 60 mgs of oral prednisone and that definitely helped. Unfortunately every time that I tried to \\&quot;wean\\&quot; off the prednisone, I couldn't get past 20mgs before the flare ups came back. And the scleritis certainly didn't discriminate, it would go in my right eye, then left. Thank God I never had it in both eyes at the same time. \r\nI saw rheumatologists, endocrinologists and different eye specialists. Fortunately (unfortunately) there was no underlying cause for the scleritis so they didn't know how to treat me. \r\nI kept pushing my eye doctor for help but he just kept telling me to give the steroids a chance. After being on the steroids for a year, on my own, I finally found a uveitis specialist that has been treating me. He put me on one drug but it wasn't enough to control the flare ups while I tried to wean off the steroids. Currently I am on a drug called methotrexate that has been helping to control my flareup. I am on 25 mgs of the methotrexate. It appears that this drug has been used to treat lymphoma (?) but the uveitis doctor said that they have found that it also helps people with scleritis. And sure enough, I can honestly say that I have not had any major flare ups in the last few months. I am currently down to 1 mg of prednisone and hope to be off in a few weeks. I hope the methotrexate can control the scleritis but if not, hopefully my doctor will know how to adjust the dosage. I may need to be on this for 2 - 3 years to help stabilize things but I don't care. It appears that not many opthalomologists know about methothrexate and because of their unfamiliarity, are unwilling to prescribe it. \r\nI feel for all of you that have this condition. I totally understand because I have been there. Try not to give up hope. Continue pushing to go to the different doctors. Try to find a uveitis specialist. Good luck and thank you for listening.

It affects both eyes, and I have head-exploding headaches to accompany the inflammation which occasionally give me dizzy spells or mini-blackout/spacey moments ,along with the usual eye/face pain, photosensitivity etc etc and sometimes the scleritis makes me feel I'm in a little bubble, separated from others,a kind of physical detachment - unable to engage with things around me. The scleritis is absolutely exhausting, and most people who don't have it just cannot understand why - the sleepless nights, the waking up in the night,and the tiredness of constant pain in the eye. \r\n\r\nI worry about my career prospects (I'd still like to do something I [b:7abd9259b2]want[/b:7abd9259b2] to do, rather than an inferior have to/can do career) since scleritis spills over into everything, whenever I have a flare-up, which is often.  Reading paper documents, using computers, TV,  even listening to music  (the vibrations)- all hurt my eyes.  Not sure I could physically manage full-time work again.  I very very very rarely wear eye make-up, though I used to enjoy it (before my scleritis kicked in).  And of course, the redness is just unsightly. \r\n\r\nHad some blood tests, which showed up nothing. Same old story of 'not sure of the underlying cause etc etc', which is of no use. My doctors are sympathetic, but don't quite understand... I use Flurbiprofen and steroid drops- though I'm less than happy with the potential long-term consequences of frequent use.\r\n\r\nI find cold compresses help for instant relief, though I'll try the hot compresses others have mentioned. Regular exercise too - v useful I find. I'm also careful about getting enough sleep, as I find that lack of sleep makes worse the pain, and I generally try to manage other aspects of my lifestyle - amount of time spent using VDU/TV etc.  Ibuprofen - love it! \r\n\r\nOn the plus side, I've not had it as long as other people on here! But I wish that someone could just wave a magic wand and cure me - I remember golden days pre-scleritis!",

After being mis diagnosed for weeks I was finally diagnosed but put on high doses of prednisone.  (60 mg) which offered relief right away.  But after coming down, the Scleritis flared up.  I was put on Methotrexate as an anti-steriodal agent and now I take 20 mg. of Methotrexate and am working my way off of Prednisone.  But even after coming down to 5 mg. of Prednisone, I began to have flare ups again.  I am so frustrated.  Like many of you, I feel like a guinea pig and that the doctors are just 'guessing'.  No one seems to know what is causing it and after MRI's and tons of blood tests, there are no answers.

I have been suffering from scleritis\r\n( currently having a flare up ) since I was 15, I'm 26 now. Prednisone, methotrexate, eye injections, pain relievers and eye drops didn't help me. I just started last week with Humira ( adalimumab ) prescribed by rheumatologist and I will post again after a couple of months using it to let you know if its working or not. Since the methotrexate started working then it didn't( 25mg weekly ). For reference They have done all kinds of tests to check for the cause even in different countries. And I go to Balcom Palmer Eye institute in Miami Florida ( the best in The USA ) and thanks God I have an eye specialist that has stood by me for the past 5 years ( Dr. Albini )\r\n\r\nI will keep you updated and be strong, ad keep your faith. I'm sure that this will go away soon!!!",

The IVMP worked wonders for 3 days but once the course had finished i was bk im trouble pain. Cellcept made me increasingly worse and made me feel like i had the flu.\r\nI was then told my case is too complicated for our local hospital and i was sent to Bristol Eye Hospital. I stayed in for 3 days for 3 more days of IVMP. I seen lots of different dr's and a professor they have told me i may neeed to have a biopsy of my eye but noone in the hosp feeels comfortable doing it because its never been done there. I am also waiting for funding to start a drug called Humira which im a bit scared about does anyone have any experience of this medication? Please help me i need guidance. Jem",

The ophthalmologist said it prob wouldn't work and he was right so i was switched to Azathioprine which cleared up the scleritis (was given the all clear a couple of weeks ago)... i have only just been switched back to methotrexate as the Aza wasn't helping my joints as the higher dose (100mg) knocked off my liver function tests... i have just had my first dose of injectable methotrexate and i am hoping that my scleritis dosen't come back because i have stopped the Aza... will keep you posted.... \r\nIf you haven't had Azathoprine prescribed for your scleritis i would suggest you mention it to your doctor as it definitely worked for me....

No one can truly understand the intense pain unless they have had it.  With scleritis sometimes there is an underlying condition that makes you get scleritis, sometimes as in my condition there isn't.  Most doctors just treat the symptoms and not the condition because it is an auto immune disease and really hard to pinpoint as there are so many variables.  I am currently on 20mg of Methotrexate and 3000ui of Vitamin D.  I still get occasional flareups and they want me to take prednisone for these episodes.  I refuse to take prednisone again.  I became so dependant upon it that coming off cause so many more health issues and staying on it started a cataract in my eye.  Today I take aleve or advil with the methotrexate, I figure those side effects are better than the prednisone.  My flareups come when I am overworked/tired.  So I try and get as much rest sometimes 10 - 12 hours a night on weekends.  I have looked into alternative medicine but you have to be your own advocate.  Know what works for your body and keep searching.  I am going to try a new regimine starting the middle of January.  If I have any success I will post here again.  It's all about trial and error.  That's all the doctors can do.",

As I was travelling abroad the following morning I didn't go to the GP. It was sore, as if someone smacked me in the eye, but no boring pain, so in the event I felt OK to chance it and seek medical help where I was going if needed rather than lose my holiday. I felt there was a connection with my stomach/bowels. Does anyone else have this? Or with celiac? \r\n\r\n(Background: I had my first inflamed eye about 5 years ago and it was then diagnosed as scleritis, based on that blanching test. I was checked for immune disorders, but nothing came up, and the eye cleared up fairly quickly (yes, I said I was lucky!). I then had it again about 18 months ago, both eyes involved this time. As it wasn't hugely painful I didn't demand to see a GP quickly, so not sure if it had gone into my sclera or not, like the first time. By the time I got to a GP it was cleared. Now I would generally ring for a speedy appointment, but as said didn't this last time as it would have meant losing my hols. My eye did gradually get better and is near to normal now.)",

Except this last summer I had a period of 'extreme' bloating (well, it felt extreme) and I sort of swelled up almost all over. I think mainly water retention. It was bad enough not only for me to feel all wrong, with very puffy feet, but also for my husband to notice. I was abroad at the time, and after some thought we decided it might well be due to something I was eating more of than I usually do, like dairy aand wheat/grain. cut out wheat/grain instantly and have stuck with it since. It must now be at least 6 weeks. And it was a relief. my bowels still haven't properly settled down though. I have been tested for celiac, at least a couple of years ago, at least 3 times, but nothing. now I don/t know where to go for some diagnosis or assistance. Non-celiak gluten sensitivity perhaps? staying off isn't hard as I don't want that experience again any time soon!",

It can be the right or the left although of late it's mostly the right.\r\nThe redness seems to be more 'red' on the part of the eye you can see, when i lift my upper eyelid up there is a distinct line where it lies where it's more a light pink rather than red. This lasts approx 5 days and i'm really getting fed up now.There's no pain as such apart from feeling as though the vessels are really prominent and when i blink i feel the lid scraping over them- the eye normally feels hot to touch and can become really itchy- although not often. I sometimes wake up with this and even before i've checked the mirror i know it's there. I've never had any discharge frome either of the eyes. \r\nOver the years i've visited my GP and been referred to an eye hospital and have been told over and over it was conjunctivitis or dry eyes. Eventually the eye hospital came up with a different diagnosis of 'polyps' or 'corneal ulcers' in the corner of the lower lids leaking a virus causing the inflammation. The polyps were surgically removed in 2006. Yes i did have small skin tags present there but i still to this day dont believe they had any part to play in this evil redness! And if they did why is it still happening??\r\nI think i'm just at the end of my tether with it and the constant questioning - \\&quot;eeh whats wrong with your eye?\\&quot;\r\n \\&quot;ooh it looks really nasty and horrible!\\&quot;\r\n\\&quot;you should get that checked out you know\\&quot;\r\n\r\nDon't they think i know it looks terrible and have tried to get some help with it!! AARRRGGHH!\r\n\r\nWell sorry to rant and rave on here but at least some of the problems i've got i'm hoping someone on here may have some advice for me",

It took doctors here in the states almost a full year and many visits to the ER due to the relentless pain it caused me. To this date we were not able to identify the source of the infection that kicked my immune system in overdrive. I was however lucky enough to see a specialist at the University of Oregon and it didn't take him long to identify my condition. I was put on Humira, a immune suppressor or sorts generally used on patients with Rheumatoid arthritis.  Not two months later I was running and active just as before the flare up. There were also no noticeable or permanent damage to joints or any other organs. After almost eight years however, I am once again beginning to feel similar symptoms although not as aggressive as the first time. I noticed that Aleeve, a commercial version of Naproxen works prety well for the inflamation and pain. Good Luck to all of you and I hope this post helps guide you the right direction. ",

                    "post": "Ive had this reactive arthritis for 5 years or longer . recently came back in force from a shoulder injury. I have always had it but it would get better with excercise. I even became a bit of a bodybuilder even with the pain. I got injured all the time but I did get lots of muscle. It seemed to help me but I would advice only bodyweights excercises cause I got injured too much. I had chlamydia a year before I got reactive arthritis really bad. I couldnt do anything anymore, it hit me real hard in the spine. I started to get stiff neck and couldnt sit down for 1 year. I got rashes etc. I have had different symptoms and about 1 year ago I thought I had aids or some bad std. To be honest this illness has caused more pain on my myself mentally thinking I am going to die or I have some STD. I had so many tests convinced I had an STD.\u00a0 I even had discharge ichy genitals and even bleeding gums(I was tested and all came back negative WTF). The bleeding gums made me believe I had aids at one stage and it was a terrible feeling waiting for 3-6 months to know if I actually had aids because I had symtoms of STD. I realised after 1 year it was the reactive arthritis again(It tricks me all the time even though I know I have RA). I hope this helps you understand that if you have the same thing as me, you can get a lot of different unexplained symptoms its absolutly amazing. To be honest you have to look at what you learn from your RA. I hate it but it has made me a different person and more in tune with nature.\u00a0 I am at breaking point after my dislocated shoulder because even my physio said they dont know if she can help. So please try not to stress your mind like I do worrying about symptoms, it will send you insane. I know first hand and I was worrying all last week. The year before was something different and the year before that was something else. I had a relativly normal life with ups and downs and unexpected turns. You need to keep moving, if you stop moving, it seems to attack more. . Please walk, try to do skipping or swimming or anything that is excercise that does not cause more pain. At first I skipped and it hurt. Over time I got better but I did use anti inflamatories to get the inflamation down at first. I am also in a flare up now where its so bad I cannot heal from a real injury. Its terrible and I pray that my shoulder gets better and need to go see my rhuemy again cos it has gotten unbearable. You do sound like you have reactive arthritis and I hope my experience doesnt sound so gloomy but I wish I was better prepared on what I needed to do earlier. most people get better within 1 year. My symptoms dont seem to be as intense as the first year. I still have problems because of my injuries. I wouldnt be suprised if my reactive arthritis crosses over with biomechanical issues. It seems to attack what is weak. Good luck and I know you will get better.",

(I live in Ireland but I am Italian). It was the worst thing ever.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnyways... Doctors don't really know very well this Disease.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have read a lot about it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDoctors that can help you are\u00a0:\r\n\r\nfirst Rheumatologist, Ophthalmologists , and Nutritionist i would say too.\r\n\r\nThe initial cure was Antibiotics,\u00a0\r\n\r\nthen Steroids tablets and after that Anti-inflammatories.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI Have been on Anti-inflammatories on and off 6 months.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough i have improved a lot, i am still not quite 100%,\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy ankle would get pains, my back a bit as well, my knees and shoulder too. They are mild pains, but annoying.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI really do not know if this will go or will stay. Apparently having HLA B27 positive is not for a good outcome in terms for the disease to get chronic.\r\n\r\nIn my case I am HLA B27 Negative, prognosis should be 12 months, but I have also read that if there has been a triads of Symptoms as in: Urethra, Eyes and joint, the outcome is not so good either.\r\n\r\nMy advice: See more Rheumatologists, research and post back on this so that we can all learn about this.\r\n\r\nAll my tests Bloods and Urine are negative. All is good. On Paper.\r\n\r\nMy next plan is to do a food intolerance blood test and see what I am intolerant to, this helps on reducing inflammation on the body.\r\n\r\nI take supplements as: Omega 3/6/9 and aloe vera gel/ juice every day.\r\n\r\n1 Difene daily (75mg)\u00a0 -- I skip this when I can.\u00a0",

I asked a doctor if you could get STDs from oral sex without a condom. when I was 17 years old. What good advice he gave me because he said you can't. So I had unprotected oral sex thinking it wasnt much of a risk. I still get upset with poor medical advice because of this. Its depressing that some doctors are so stupid. I am just glad I dont have HIV and can probably say that I am a very lucky in some ways I didnt catch something worse. Bacteria definatly caused my problem, there is no doubt on that but I guess certain environmental or gentic factors set you up for the possibility of a long term problem. Physical trauma to my spine is what progressed it or even triggered a reaction. It makes sence to me in a lot of ways. I just dont know if its still bacteria or auto immune. I guess once I get my joints tested then I can see, but its feels like its more than just my joints."

Although they can not find anything wrong with me except high crp level in acute disease.\u00a0I firmly believe it is because of the chlamydia bacteria likewise in most cases of venereal involvement.\u00a0 It can not be easily\u00a0 detected in urine or from blood. Actually,\u00a0 it can be detected from synovial fluid of the joints as I searched. However, once it triggers the immune system it does not matter. Also with HLAB27 positivity make the prognosis worse.Though I have it, I did go into remission once for 6 months. It feels like you are in heaven. Now I am in a middle of a\u00a0 flame and also diagnosed with early sacroilitis. I feel mild pain in my feet, knees and back.\u00a0 I am using sulfasalazine and diclofenac to protect the joints and to go into remission for the second time. There is an alternative therapy with long term\u00a0 combination of antibiotics treatment in the late literature. There are some protocols and sites mentioning it also. I will give a try if sulfa drug will not work.\r\n\r\nI am really firghtened but the war still is on.Keep fighting guys and hope to hear good news from you all.",

So severe I could not walk.  then severe rib pain-costochondritis.  X-ray and then later MRI showed severe edema and partial fusion in the sacroiliac joint on one side. Diagnosis was ankylosing spondylitis by three different rheumatologists. 2 blood tests showed i was HLA B27 negative. Took Humira shots for one and a half years. Started to feel better.  Wanted to stop taking the Humira so I could get pregnant with my third child. Follow up MRI showed completely absolutely 100% normal. No signs of disease. I have been disease free since. rheumatologist maintains remission doesnt happen like that with ankylosing spondylitis. now i know it was reactive arthritis presenting as AS on MRI. and the cause was HERPES infection. i know thats viral not bacterial but i know after all these years it was the trigger. good luck to all.

I also have ME/CFS which was diagnosed when I was 15 years old.\r\n\r\nIn July I had sore throat that lasted for 3 weeks and wasn't getting any better so I visited my GP.  She thought it was a virus but did a swab anyway.  Over the next few days I noticed weakness, pain and swelling in my hands and knees, worse on the right side of my body.  The pain got so severe I could not stand or use my hands.  I went back to the GP and was told my swab tested positive for strep.  I was given a course of penicillin and told to take ibuprofen and co-codamol for the pain.  I was also given omeprazole to protect my stomach as I had gastritis a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe pain continued for 2 weeks, I had another course of antibiotics but it wasn't helping so I was admitted to hospital where I was diagnosed with Post Streptococcal Reactive Arthritis.  I was given stronger antibiotics and painkillers and a steroid injection (kenalog) and discharged.  I gradually improved over the next few weeks but then in October I got a chest infection and another throat infection.  3 weeks later the Reactive Arthritis flared up again.  \r\n\r\nI was referred to a rheumatologist who examined me and said there was nothing wrong with my joints.  He did lots of blood tests but they all came back negative except for a borderline strep count.  I was discharged back to my GP as the rheumatologist couldn't help me because my arthritis was caused by infections.  He said I needed investigations to find out why I was getting so many strep infections.  I went to see my GP but she said there is nothing they can do.  She said there is nothing wrong with my immune system because my blood tests are normal.\r\n\r\nI had another throat infection in January and another in March, both of which lead to reactive arthritis flare ups.  I am very fed up of being ill and in pain all the time.  The doctors don't seem to be taking me seriously at all and the only treatment I've been given is codeine and paracetamol for the pain.\r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate any help or advice.  Surely the medical profession can do more than just give me painkillers?  Thank you!\r\n\r\nClair",

I also had erythema nodosum with one infection.  I was ill for 18 months or so after each infection with an ME like illness although I wasn't diagnosed with ME until 18 months ago, when I developed similar symptoms to the poststreptococcal periods i.e. musclar pain, arthritis, exhaustion and generally feeling very ill.  My ESR was always high\r\npost strep and it was high again when I was diagnosed with ME (ESR 48).  The consultant endocrinologist said it didn't matter that it was high and I should just learn \\&quot;pacing\\&quot; but I wasn't willing to accept that.  In the meantime my joints were getting more painful and stiff (especially my neck) and the ESR was still rising so I got a referral to rheumatology.  \r\n \r\nHe diagnosed cervical spondylosis and put me on diclofenac and co-dydramol and send me for physio, but still no explanation about the raised ESR.  I got a second opinion at a London teaching hospital where the rheumatologist was great and diagnosed chronically recurring strep infection and strep arthritis.  I am now on permanent penicillin and feel much better, as symptoms just recur if I stop taking it.\r\n\r\nI think you should ask for a second opinion for rheumatology at a teaching hospital with a good reputation for rheumatology.  You are entitled to see a doctor who listens to you and will help you get well rather than just fobbing you off and leaving you ill.  I think that some ME is certainly due to a chronically recurring strep infection and as you have so much history of this, may be permanent penicillin would help you as well.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.",

I did this and I was instantly seen by a rheumatologist who diagnosed me and has seen me for three months. My symtpoms haven't improved much but I am waiting for my next line of treatment which will be DMARD's. \r\n\r\nI tried painkillers, ibuprofen and then steroids as a shot and then tablet forms for 3 weeks. I am on naproxen and Co dydramol 30mg codeine.  You really need to be asking if you can take DMARD's such as Methotrexate or Sulfasalzine. They can refer you to a rheumatologist and should not be just sending you back to your GP. I was seen at UCLH which is a brilliant hospital and I know treatment won't be the same in other parts of the UK but they should not just be sending you back to your GP after failing to treat you properly. I would demand a change in medication. Naproxen, higher dose of codeine potentially and steroids to calm down your immune system but this might be a problem if you're getting infections - it definitely sounds like you will need to have the underlying cause of your arthritis treated before they try and calm your immune system down.  You definitely need more tests done, I would just keep pushing to be taken seriously, GP's are not the be all and end all and I have personally had a disaster with GP's in the past. This is your health and you need to be firm and demand a referral to a specialist facility or place a formal complaint. I wish you all the best. ",

            "post": "2nd time getting flu shot. 5 days later woke up feeling like hit by truck.  Did not know what was wrong.   Symptoms continued to worsen.  All joints very painful. Wrists shoulders knees hips ankles.  Significant swelling in ankles warranted stat venous doppler to rule out blood clots which was negative.  All lab tests negative. RA negative. Ruled out Rickettsial etc lyme disease etc.  Went on steroids and had major improvement until about 36 hours off.  Symptoms all came back and were significantly worse.  Cant walk in mornings. Major pain. Ran low grade fever around 100 each day.  More lab tests. Sedrate was 63.  Went about 10 days in major pain. Dr put me back on steroids for 2nd time.  Felt much better.    When steroids were done about 24 hours later the symptoms came back so bad i literally wanted to die.  Never had pain this bad.  In the mornings felt like i was walking with all bones crushed in my feet with concrete blocks on them.  It took all i had to get to the bathroom or move.  The pain was so bad my body trembled uncontrollably.  My ankles were so swollen i could not get any shoes on.   Doctor put me on 3rd round of steroids.   This was the week of Christmas 2015.  When this round of steroids was done the symptoms were gone. I saw an orthopedist who specializes in joints and a rheumatologist who both concluded i had an antibody antigen reaction that caused all my synovial tissue in the joints to be attacked by a virus.  For 3 years i was exempted from receiving flu shot.  No issues.  Now they are denying my exemption saying it was an adverse reaction not a contradiction.  I am scared to death to have to go thru this again.  If i dont get the shot i will lose my job and i have been an employee there for 30 years.  I work in an off site office and am not around patients.  ",

            "user": "amy76521",
            "post": "Hi all, I was diagnosed with Reactive Arthritis about 2 weeks after contracting Strep throat. I'm currently about 5 weeks in.\r\n\r\nThe M.D. sent me home with advice to rest and take Ibuprofen, and that's it. I had already begun a course of antibiotics from a walk-in clinic Dr. I'd seen previously.\r\n\r\nBeing a Naturopathic Dr. myself, I couldn't allow myself to wallow in misery and do nothing to help myself. I hauled out my old textbooks to see what course of action might be advised.\r\n\r\nI knew that certain foods increased inflammation and immune reactivity. I decided to start off with an old-school water fast to help calm down the inflammatory cytokine activity.\r\n\r\nI'm used to intermittent fasting for about 19 hours per day, which helps increase one's tolerance. It also helps to eat ketogenically for a couple of days beforehand to get your body accustomed to burning your fat instead of glucose.\r\n\r\nFirst attempt, I managed 52 hours. 12 hours after eating, the pain came roaring back. I next managed a 5 1/2 day fast with some electrolytes ( potassium, magnesium,  and sea salt) in water. My body hit a wall at that point, so I broke the fast for 2 days. the pain increased again, so I did one final fast. The idea is to fast until 1-2 days after resolution of symptoms. I made it another 5 1/2 days. That seems to be the maximum my body can tolerate, and I was feeling very weak. The electrolytes were no longer helping. Time to stop. My pain was considerably better and stayed so this time as I carefully reintroduced foods.\r\n\r\nI researched the Autoimmune Paleo diet (AIP) to come up with a plan. I wanted to avoid any foods which were known to increase inflammation.\r\n\r\nI also saw a traditional Chinese (TCM) doc, who checked me over and declared that my case was no longer very severe,  but that I needed to build up my strength ( Kidney Qi in TCM language). Not really a surprise,  considering all the fasting. I had lost about 20 lbs in 2 weeks. It really helped the inflammation,  but it comes at a cost.\r\n\r\nI began eating the following foods: homemade bone broth with some organic bouillon mixed in for flavor. Well-cooked broccoli, kale, cauliflower, asparagus, steamed sweet potatoes, cinnamon, turmeric,  coconut oil. Canned health food store wild salmon. Fresh juices from beets, ginger, lemon, grapefruit together, or cucumber lemon kale ginger sometimes.\r\n\r\nAroy-D coconut milk in tetrapaks mixed with chia seeds and frozen wild blueberries.\r\n\r\nSymptoms really improved and stabilized. I also added some chicken liver pat\u00e9 to help rebuild Qi, and raw walnuts.\r\n\r\nI also got 3 home visits from an RMT who does myofascial work. Helped a lot. On the last visit he used a Dolphin Neurostim on my back and neck acupuncture points. Amazing!\r\n\r\nI now only take ibuprofen at bedtime. I can walk around my neighborhood and do errands. If I eat inflammatory foods, I feel it. \r\n\r\nI still feel more fatigue than usual. I try to take it easy. But I'm functional again. I feel pretty confident that I'll have this resolved in a couple of months rather than years.\r\n\r\nIf you're out there and suffering, perhaps this will give you some ideas.\r\n\r\n",

I hope you can move from your moldy home and find a practitioner to help you with the Lyme and the heavy metal issue. I hope you have been able to identify and eliminate the source of the heavy metals. Coriander leaf springs to mind as a natural chelating agent that may be helpful.\r\n\r\nI'd definitely suggest looking at the AIP diet to help manage pain. \r\n\r\nThrough the intermittent fasting community I have also heard of excellent health benefits from red light therapy such as the Joovv device. Might be worth looking into to help with your toxic burden. Or perhaps even far-infrared saunas, used regularly. Getting the elimination pathways open and functioning optimally is really key.\r\n\r\nHope you get feeling better soon!"

I had done some googling before going to see my family Dr and had myself very scared that it was Rheumatic Fever-- I never got any search results for ReA because Strep is a fairly uncommon cause of it. You have to specifically search for \"post strep reactive arthritis\" to find anything.\r\n\r\nMy MD checked my heart, including EKG, and fortunately the heart is not involved. My MD is a recent graduate so her training is very fresh and up to date. She also said she'd had a similar case in the previous month. \r\n\r\nI know many people are skeptics these days, but if I were you, suffering so long without a medically identifiable cause, I'd go for alternative medicine. I have seen miraculous results in many seemingly hopeless cases with homeopathy, when performed by an experienced, classically-Hahnemannian-trained practitioner.\r\n\r\nI am also currently seeing an experienced chiropractor to help resolve my lingering joint pain and pins-and-needles sensation on the bottom of my foot. I think that is also an excellent idea. Restoring proper nerve function can markedly improve immune function, potentially resolving symptoms."

I could not roll over at night without agony and would wake drenched in sweat and need my bedding changed.  I could not stand without support for 4-5 months. I was on long and slow release oxycodone, corticosteroids and methotrexate upon discharge. My inflammation markers and WBC counts were through the roof. I do have HLA B27 so that can drag the autoimmune dysfunction process out. I am still taking methotrexate almost a year later and just getting well now. \r\nI have been following Dr Amy Myers program, but in the initial stages of the disease diet alone would have been ineffective, ibuprofen wouldn't have scratched the surface.  I will try the fasting to speed this last healing stage up. Thank you",

I am back to walking everywhere, carrying heavy loads, and yoga 3x/week. \r\n\r\nI am currently back to my intermittent fasting , of 19-20 hours/day of consuming only water,  black coffee or decaf or black or green tea, no flavours or sweeteners. One addition that really has helped, is that my daughter was put on a special diet that is as close to zero processed foods as possible ( low free glutamate diet for autism), and I eat what she eats. We are both doing great on it. I cook a good quality piece of meat or fish, serve it with a big salad with homemade lemon garlic olive oil dressing and beans cooked from scratch. fruit or a bit of coconut milk fruit smoothie for dessert. Lots of green veg and nettle tea for calcium. \r\n\r\nI tried having a piece of my son's homemade gluten free oat flour banana bread, and had a huge relapse the next day. It seems oats set me off,   as I've eaten all the other ingredients with no problems. I also came across a discussion online a while ago where Rheumatoid Arthritis sufferers were discussing which starches caused a flare in symptoms  for them. Different starches caused problems for people, even something as seemingly innocuous as sweet potato or rice.

I find that I personally do best when I open my eating window at 5 pm, and begin with a nutritious meal, rather than snacking before dinner. My eating window is between 2-5 hours,  depending upon how much food my body seems to need. \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, I have my black coffee diluted half with water, along with one NAC pill (great for autoimmune conditions), and my usual serrapeptase.  Black decaf, black or green tea, water, or carbonated water until 5pm. \r\n\r\nDuring the day, I try to rest around 2pm and I do a progressive muscle relaxation in lieu of a nap, as I don't nap well. I have been using The Meditation Podcast's episode 14:Rejuvenating Sleep for this purpose daily for nearly 10 years now. It is so vital to me that when I changed phones and lost my old free copy, I gladly joined patreon for $2/month to get access to it again. I recharges me like a 1-hour nap so I can go get my kids from school and keep my temper much better until bedtime.\r\n\r\nMelatonin works great for me, so I take 2 sprays of Genestra's spearmint flavor near bedtime. If I'm feeling wired, I do the Rejuvenating Sleep relaxation again and it always does the trick. I sleep on my side and use a body pillow to prevent low back pain. Back sleeping with a pillow under the knees may help, too.\r\n\r\nI hope something in all this might help you. Good luck!"

One day my wrists were swollen and stiff, the next day they were fine but my ankles would then swell, does this happen to anyone else? I've been prescribed steroids which have seemed to calm everything down. I went back to work, but that evening my knees swelled up again and were stiff. This is after being on steroids for 3 weeks and resting for 2 weeks. It seems my body is still recovering I think. Any suggestions or similar experiences?  Getting very frustrated as I am only 22 and need to be at work! Thank you.",

I have all the classic symptoms of ReA and I have been in and out of the doctors and specialist offices \u00a0for which I\u2019m not able to get much resolution or a definite diagnosis. \u00a0Symptoms have been on and off for over six months, however this month has been the absolute worst as the constant neck pain along with the random rotation of joint pains in my fingers, toes, knees, elbows, prostate, blader, chest, abdomen... which comes and goes with a vengeance. \u00a0Obviously as most of you all, I have tested negative for any bactaerias or infections.\u00a0\r\nCurrently I am on Cipro again and Hydrocodone for the pain. I was also taking Meloxicam for the inflammation however that amplified all the different pains. I was reading about a study that University of Southern California done where they found fasting for 3 -4 days resets the immune system. I was curious if anyone here has tried this or not as this seems it would help many of us here if fasting will actually reset our immune systems and make it stop attacking our bodies. \u00a0Thanks ~ JC\u00a0",

While I didn&#39;t fast, diet played a huge role in my recovering from reactive arthritis. </p><p></p><p>Over a year ago, I was diagnosed with reactive arthritis or HLA-B27 associated inflammatory arthritis. I didn&#39;t have any bacterial infection or at least didn&#39;t discover any. I recovered fully from changing my lifestyle and diet. The symptoms you are describing is exactly what I had- I had extreme pain in my joints which started in my right knee and toe joints that would rotate around then eventually started going up to my back (spine) and even my fingers. I couldn&#39;t walk for several months and it felt like it was never going to get better. </p><p></p><p>The doctor asked if I wanted to take strong drugs that suppress your immune system and urged me to take heavy doses of ibuprofen to manage the pain but I didn&#39;t listen to any of it. Instead I did some more research and found useful info from a book called Conquering Arthritis (by [b]Barbara Allan[/b]). I took a food sensitivity blood test as mentioned in the book and eventually cut out these things from my diet: gluten, sugar, dairy, alcohol, caffeine and basically anything processed. I was left with eating very basic whole foods everyday for at least a good 6 months, but even doing it for a day or two immediately made me feel better. I followed a strict diet until I recovered completely... It left me pain free and feeling and looking good (from losing weight). </p><p>Now I&#39;ve reintroduced these foods back to my diet slowly and in moderation and I&#39;m happy to report that I am not getting any inflammation. My life is back to normal and I really think that diet helps cleanse your digestive tract which then will help reset your immune system.</p><p></p><p>I recommend you stop taking prescribed medicine that will only mask your symptoms. You have to get to the source of the problem which starts from your guts. I&#39;m confident that it will help you recover as it did for me.

I think it&#39;s very clear that the medicines do work at least partially or entirely for many of us struggling with this disease. I totally see why you&#39;d say that. But there are side effects to these medicines, for some people, very severe side effects, and many people find themselves bouncing from one medicine to another, then trying combinations of different ones. It can take years of trial and error to find the best medicines suited for your needs, and can get quite expensive. There are also some pretty serious health issues linked to taking medicines long term.</p><p></p><p>There is not an &quot;eat-a-banana, you&#39;re cured&quot; formula, but I think I get what you&#39;re saying - if diets the answer, why would they go through so much effort to make these pills? Well, a lot of rich pharmaceutical owners profit off our taking these pills day after day, especially pain killers which can have you taking more and more. Saying to change your diet is not a popular idea yet in America, but in many other parts of the world it is more encouraged as a way of healing. And many, many people swear that they&#39;ve taken a food sensitivity test, followed the diet, and seen amazing results. I can see why it&#39;s an appealing other option - no side effects now or long term, and is not much more expensive than your diet currently is. There are a lot of good documentaries on Netflix about the effects of inflammatory foods on people&#39;s immune system that have been studied with great proof. If you chose to watch them they could change your mind!</p><p></p><p>As you could probably guess from my post, I do a little of both. I&#39;m on the highest dose of sulfasalazine and follow the anti-inflammatory diet about 80-95%. I don&#39;t feel totally better so I&#39;m considering sticking more to the diet rather than finding more meds but I really don&#39;t think one way is totally right and the others wrong. Just wanted to throw in my two cents! Thanks for reading my opinion!</p>"

I lost my appetite because of stress and as you can imagine the grossness. I eventually caught it and did not eat much for about a week. We went on a 6 week vacation and during that time my appetite came back. During my vacation my grandmother died and I got stressed and lost appetite again. From June to late August I felt pretty good. some very minor ankle pain, back got better, less tired. I was very happy. \r\n\r\nIn August life got normal again and my symptoms got much worse than before. I started sulfasalazine in September. My symptoms haven't improved, my MRI shows no change. \r\n\r\nRight before Christmas my son got Rotavirus. He was having diarrhea for 3 weeks and we had to cancel our trip to Abu Dhabi. Again I got stressed and lost my appetite. I started to feel normal again. \r\n\r\nI do notice improvement with fasting or extremely low calories. when I go back to normal diet I get worse again. Right now I am eating normal waiting to see if things get really bad again. If they do I will fast again. Another thing is the type of food I eat doesn't matter. I ate a gluten free, sugar free, dairy free, meat free, soy free, fried food\r\nfree, and egg free diet with normal calorie intake and there was no improvement after a few weeks. ",

It was treated though. I had a good gp. The bowel infection i had ( diverticulitis) actually caused my bowel to rupture, that was late 2017, and i never felt well after i came out of hospital, always felt ill, chills, feeling generally awful, then i developed a pain in my back and blladder. long story short, i went back to the gastro and demanded further investigations. 3 colonoscopies later, one done by my wonderful,surgeon who was able to complete it, and i had my answer. a huge abscess the size of an orange, stick to my bladder and various other things. Hence the surgeries. I shoukd be feeling great by now. The surgeries were successful, but i have this other stuff now, and when i read about the reiter syndrome, i thought this seems so much like what i feel like. Its 100 degrees this week where i live and im walking around with a cardigan! I am constantly freezing. sorry to ramble, but something isnt right, my gp is on holiday and i feel lost, i dont know who to turn to. i have made an appointment with my surgeon, but thats not until april. He is wonderful, if he cant help me he can point me in the right direction. "

I Am not a doctor and i don't know exactly whats going on in your body. i do know that some supplemments can help with inflammation. I was totally clueless back when i got treated for that infection. doctors don't really have any answers. all they can do is treat you for the infection, give you some steriods /prednisone for your inflammation and send you on your way. you should definitely ask to  get tested for the gene. at least you won't be in the dark about why you're having these symptoms. i was also treated with sulfasulazine. didn't do much for me though. everyone's body works different."

Bowel function ok now. I have developed some strange symptoms though, and i believe i have now developed some kind of arthritis type thing related to my bowel disease. I realise i had some of these symptoms before my surgeries, but they have just progressed. I  had tingling and pins and needles after surgeries, which were put down to low ferritin, which i had. Had  iron infusion etc. all iron levels normal now.  I have that still , but now ,  neck pain, arm pain. terrible low back pain, which is better after some physio, and i do excercises she recommended.  Now developed awful leg pain at night if i have been sitting too long. alleviated by moving and all much better if i keep moving and keep mobile. i am also incredibly sensitive to cold. It was only after a conversation i had with a relative overseas that has active bowel disease, and has a kind of arthritis problem through having it, that i realised my symptoms are very similar. My gp doesnt know enough about this, and i have made an appointment withh my bowel surgeon  to discuss it. I think i should be seeing a rheumatologist?  Can anyone shed any light on this for me please? Anyone going through same thing. ?  ",

No i had diverticulitis infections for years before i was diagnosed properly, my gastro kept telling me it was irritable bowel syndrome. I was really ill but he did not think my symptoms were an inflamed bowel. By the time i was diagnosed i had a massive abscess stuck to my bladder and a lot of damage in there, so i lost 8 inches of bowel, had a bag for 3 months, and then a reversal. So basically i had an inflamed and infected bowel on and off for years. "

            "post": "<p>Just thought I&#39;d post about my experience thus far to help people, as it seems difficult to find information about ReA owing to it being fairly rare and often Peters out before getting a diagnosis. </p><p></p><p>On March 20th 2018 I rushed cooking some hunters chicken. 4 days later I had developed full blown (sorry for the pun) gastroenteritis, which was terribly painful for 4 days and ended in a course of antibiotics. The other &#39;effects&#39; hung around for a further fortnight.</p><p></p><p>On the last day of the infection my hands swelled up really painfully. The day after that I had lower back pain so  bad I couldn&#39;t even roll over in bed. The following day hands swollen again.  </p><p></p><p>Over the next fortnight I was only eating 2 plain bagels a day due to my the battle damage in my gut and became lactose intolerant. Hands were also a bit tender from swelling. </p><p></p><p>And then the ReA started.</p><p></p><p>Initially it was just palms, soles of feet and fingers that were swolen. I could push through with just ibuprofen. No biggie life goes on.</p><p></p><p>Then the knees got in on the game within a month of the original infection. If I was sat for an hour or more I would struggle to walk for the first 100meters (Think shuffling feet, knees frozen bent, looking like quasimodo).</p><p></p><p>My Dr didn&#39;t really know what to do or know anything about ReA. She just gave me omazerpole to stop ibuprofen giving stomach ulcers.</p><p></p><p>About 3 months after the original infection it then got bad.... the toes got in on the game properly along with the soles of the feet. Think can&#39;t walk with a heel strike and can&#39;t roll forwards on the toes. My workmates started calling me the penguin because of how I shuffled about. Ibuprofen was was still enough to make it bearable so I kept missioning on expecting improvement in a few weeks. </p><p></p><p>But this stayed ebbing and flowing or months. Sometimes I&#39;d have a go at gardening and it would be fine. Other days I&#39;d push myself to fill and move a wheelbarrow and id collapse crying from frustration at not being able to do simple stuff. It does your nut in to be able to think straight and feel good be physically fit at just 37 but not be able to do anything physical.</p><p></p><p>Then, woohoo, 3 pain free days. I was exstatic.  Could this be the start of the end after 5 month of pain and frustration?</p><p></p><p>Nope. </p><p></p><p>At the end of August i got a rash over most of my body and my hands knees and feet swelled and hurt really bad.  Using my hands and walking more that 100m were off the cards entirety and i coukd feel the ReA heading for my back. By now ibuprofen was doing nothing to help.</p><p></p><p>Cue a Saturday &#39;emergency&#39; Drs appointment. Luckily the locum had seen ReA before and knew what to do. More omazerpole and this time some naproxen for swelling, 500mg 2x a day. Also blood tests.</p><p></p><p>Though the first naproxen dose made me fall asleep within 45 minutes of taking it, and I think caused a mild 2 hour long euphoric mania, it worked like magic on the ReA.</p><p></p><p>A week on and I no longer have foot pain when I wake up, and though I can feel the ReA lurking in the background, I&#39;ve just spent a week in a forest retreat walking 5 plus miles a day without any issues.</p><p></p><p>The ReA is not gone, but it&#39;s definitely managed by the naproxen, and I can do almost everything again. I just take one dose of 500mg in an evening and it&#39;s enough to stave off the overnight inflammation. Currently awaiting the blood test results to see if there is a long term solution.</p><p></p><p>The lactose intolerance also seems here to stay as a reminder of the gastroenteritis. I miss breakfast cereal with propper milk the most, and sometimes risk a vanilla slice then suck up the consequences because life&#39;s not worth living without the odd vanilla slice.</p>",

It only ever afftected me badly one time, I couldn&#39;t walk because my ankle hurt so bad, the doctors took x-rays to find nothing. For weeks I would cry to my legs hurt and my parents thought they were growing pains until I colapsed in the middle of the night in the hall way going to the bathroom, my legs just gave out- I remember that to this day. For almost a month durning this whole time I was going to get my blood drawn twice maybe three times a week come to find out I had strep throat the entire time and it was extremely bad, I did have my toncils at the time, they were HUGE but I didn&#39;t feel any pain in my throat that entire time. Now that I am 20 I&#39;m experiencing some health issues doctors cannot seem to find the answer to.. a year ago (age 19) I weighed 193lbs 5&#39; 7&quot; female now 20 I weigh 140 lbs and I didn&#39;t change anything about my diet OR excersize, before weighing 193lbs i never weighed over 160 I gained all of the weight after high school witch was understandable, change, no more sports(I was very active in high school), no excersizing at all literally. When I started to gain weight I started to get sick not feel very good never want to do anything and then one day I started to wake up feeling sick every morning, thought maybe pregnant but nope. I was not. I started to feel and get sick during the day keeping down anything was hard. The doctor, a GI specialist had me get a colonoscopy done ( I was 19, 183lbs at this time) the only thing he found was inflammation in my stomach which led him to believe I may have celiacs disease, I started to drink a shake call thrive (gluten free) and I started to get sick less but I was still always so tired, a year later after letting my diet slip back and doing everything the same the doctor was shocked to see I weighed 140lbs I realized I had lost weight but not THAT MUCH and how?! I have to clue&#160;</p>",

                    "post": "Hello ... as a female you should be aware that arthritis seems to strike you \"folk\" more often than males. I have been to many arthritis support groups in the past. I noticed that the women were predominantly over-weight and the men predominantly under-weight, although I wouldn't necessarily conclude that observation as \"damning\".\r\nYou MUST control your weight; otherwise, you will experience what I saw among those in the support groups: more weight, more depression, more pain, and increasingly poor posture and poor self-esteem. Those are just \"starters\".\r\nDo NOT let weight gain discourage or prevent you from exercise. I have found that during my attacks when I must reduce my level of exercise that I feel somewhat depressed and somewhat more tired. When you are active most likely you will be among other people. That in itself boosts your self-esteem and confidence. Plus, exercise encourages you to drink more water that helps your skin, your kidneys, your blood, and basically your entire body. So, check the web for more information and get off your butt. :-) \r\nCheck with your doctors, dieticians, and friends.\r\n hope I have given your some help and information!",

After numerous hospital visits I was eventually kept in for 2 days for blood tests, MRIs, rheumatology appointments and physio. They came to the conclusion I must have developed ReA after a throat infection. I also had my knee drained of fluid twice and injected with steroids, which relieved nearly all symptoms for about a week. I left hospital 2 weeks ago and I am able to walk but the pain is constant and a return to sport is seeming quite far away.

After a few weeks my knees then blew right up too, hips followed and doing anything was almost unbearable . After numerous GP trips with them not knowing what I had I was sent to the rheumatologist who straight away told me I had ReA. Tried various drugs, Sulphazaline, Methotrexate and eventually Quinoric which helped plus oral steroids. Only survived to this point due to injected steroids which temporarily relieved the pain. Lost almost three stone in a few weeks. Problems continued up to my hips which were both destroyed now need replacing but trying to delay it till I can&#39;t manage any more. Must say my rheumatologist did not believe in draining joints as in his opinion they just filled up again almost straight away. Stayed on drugs for about 21/2 years now just take prescription painkillers. Have had no major flares but have had episcleriis (eyes) which is related and sadly just feel I have never really got rid of it and my affected joints are all damaged to differing degrees. Sadly this disease affects us all differently. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones who gets better in a few months and isn&#39;t stuck with it long term.</p>",

                    "post": "You started with ReA (aka Reiter's Syndrome) later in life than I did. I first noticed it when I was about six years old. My ankles would hurt and swell after walking too much on concrete sidewalks. Later, when I was fifteen, I got a stomach \"bug\". About six weeks later I began to lose my flexibility. It took several months before it subsided. A year or so later I got the flu and then German measles. While battling the flu, I took lots of aspirin. It worked so well, that I went in a cross-country ski race the day after I left the infirmary. The next day I had German measles. The cross-country ski coach had \"issues\" because he said I could not go in a race that weekend unless I took the time trial.\r\nThe next big attack occurred after I got strep throat from a girlfriend's one and only son. I don't know where they went but I noticed black and blue ankles after bicycling on the roads. It took about six weeks before I really started to hurt. I went to a local ER because I thought I was in trouble. The docs thought I might have a block vein in my leg but I didn't. I started on Indocin for about eight weeks before I went to that doctor's  med school professor, a rheumie from England. That seemed to work for that attack.\r\nA few years later I got cellulitis in my left leg. It began with an infection on my left knee that morphed about two weeks after the initial infection. My sed rate went over 100. I had to be in the hospital for two days on IV anti-biotics. My rheumie said he was considering removing my left leg! That attack lasted for nine months. I lost 14 pounds in the next two weeks. The rheumie added methotrexate to my drug regimen when the sed rate seemed fixed at 45 or so. That brought my sed rate to normal within eight weeks. I also developed psoriatic arthritis; both my feet had pustules that looked like poison ivy blisters. Walking was \"itchy\". My socks showed the \"drips\" from the pustules. It was unpleasant!\r\nI have had several attacks in the past thirty years. I have continued with methotrexate (subcu).\r\nAbout two years ago another attack started after I spent some time with my dying mother in a rehab center. I must have gotten some type of \"bug\" there. A few months later my sed rate went from ten to 85 before it slowly returned to normal. My rheumie prescribed Remicade (infusion) because even though the sed rate had returned to normal, my neck and back were stiff. In fact, I have fused vertebrae in my neck, lumbar, and sacroliliac. \r\nYou should do some personal research on the web and elsewhere on forms of arthritis, especially Reiter's (ReA). Be careful where you eat, you walk, you drink, and with whom you have any form of bodily contact (kissing, intercourse). If in doubt, don't. Use protection always!\r\nI have done all of the above, plus trying to keep as physically active as possible. I have biked (mountain and road), skied (downhill and cross-country), kayaked, canoed, swam, run, hiked, hill-bounded, and plain walked. Until I was in a bus accident seven years ago I was very successful in spite of my Reiter's. I got a nasty concussion in the accident that lingered for three years. I could not do much exercise because I got nasty migraines. I am now in much worse shape.\r\nMy drug regimen now is gabapentin, methotrexate (subcu weekly), Remicade (infusion every four weeks), folic acid, COQ10, clopidogrel (I used Vioxx and got a few TIAs), and a few other drugs for asthma and allergies.\r\nI hope you don't lose hope at your young age! You really don't have many other alternatives but if you are willing to bear pain and to hope for the future, you can live with the disease. Two final thoughts: do NOT let yourself gain weight (it'll destroy your weight bearing joints) AND since you most likely are HLAb27 positive, don't think of having children. But then if my life and my observations of many arthritis support groups are indicative, you probably will have very few significant sexual relationships. Most of the people I saw with arthritis were already single or divorced. It's just the reality.",

The first use of prednisone pills thirty years ago did absolutely nothing. The second use of the pills seemed to work for a few weeks until I noticed I was getting very verbally angry with my dog. She left my room with her tail between her legs. I knew then that I had to stop, so I talked with my doctor about how I should taper.\r\n\r\nI did that and have since tried other meds; Humira (nothing), Cosentyx (nothing), Otezla (made me depressed), and now Remicade (seems to work very well).\r\n\r\nRegarding your jaws, please be careful! I had to have both TMJs replaced five years ago. Avoid jewing gum! Have you considered a bite guard for the evening when you are sleeping? What about exercises (isometric and all the rest)? I found that keeping active was, besides the drugs, the best treatment I did; such as swimming, hill-bounding, cross-country skiing, and bicycling, All the herbal and food diets, and acupuncture did not help.\r\n\r\nI hope this information helps you!",

                    "post": "<p>This is my first post to this forum. I have had reactive arthritis since childhood. It first began when I was 10, and I am now 64. The good news is that I have learned how to stop it cold. Many of you may not believe me, but those who do may find substantial benefit from what works for me.&#160;</p><p>My first experience with remission was when I was about 35 years old. My wife (ex-wife now) started drinking 2% milk to lose weight. I reluctantly started also using it for my cereal in the morning. I did not know why, but my symptoms decreased. My ex-wife started drinking non-fat milk. I reluctantly also started using it in my cereal. I also stopped eating ice cream because I was gaining weight. in a very short time my symptoms disappeared. Once I begin to think that milk fat might be a cause of my symptoms, I strictly followed a no milk-fat diet and avoided animal fat. To test my theory, and to succumb to my desire to eat ice cream, twice in a period of about 18 months, I binged on ice cream for a short while. My symptoms started to return, so I backed off. This minimal data (not sufficient for statistical proof) convinced me that my reactive arthritis was, at a minimum, aggravated by animal fat. Since that time, I have had some re-occurrences, including some fairly severe ones. Those re-occurrences generated additional theories about causative factors. In the worst re-occurrence, about two years ago, it was persistent daily Ibuprofen (only 400 mg per day during no-symptom periods) that was the culprit. When the symptoms got bad, I took more Ibuprofen, which in retrospect, only made matters worse. When I finally stopped the Ibuprofen, the symptoms disappeared in two weeks. I was taking some probiotics at the time.</p><p>The last recurrence, about 4 months ago, was due to a switch from filtered water to tap water (when my refrigerator water filter system stopped working) - specifically the chlorine in the tap water. By this time, I was thoroughly convinced that, in my case, reactive arthritis was a result of leaky gut[/b] syndrome[/b]. I connected the dots. It only took a few days, after buying a high-grade water filter, for my symptoms to be gone.</p><p></p><p>Here are the dots, connected:</p><p>1&#160; A reactive arthritis episode is often preceded by a stomach or other infection.</p><p>2. For me, episodes have occurred after consumption of NON_ORGANIC milk fat. Note that non-organic milk fat has a bunch of antibiotics in it, and a bad balance of Omega 3 to Omega 6 fatty acids (as does feed-lot feed beef). I now can drink all of the ORGANIC full-fat milk and ice cream I want, without getting RA symptoms.</p><p>3. Chlorine in water resulted in an episode, and elimination of the chlorine stopped the episode cold.</p><p>4. Long term consumption of Ibuprofen killed off my gut bacteria. Stopping, along with taking probiotics, stopped my symptoms.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? [b]Leaky gut[/b] is the cause of RA in me. Maintaining healthy gut flora is essential to eliminating [b]leaky gut[/b]. NSAIDS (Ibuprofen, etc) kill healthy gut bacteria when used for long periods of time. Chlorine kills healthy gut bacteria. Stomach infections, such as salmonella, kill healthy gut bacteria. Chlorine in water kills healthy gut bacteria. Antibiotics in milk (and other non-organic animal protein) kill healthy gut bacteria. Why would [b]leaky gut[/b] cause RA? [b]Leaky gut[/b] allows larger molecules to enter your blood stream from your intestines. These larger molecules are not ones your immune system expects, so when these larger molecules lodge in your tissues (especially tissues with minimal circulation such as tendons and cartridge), your immune system goes after those molecules, damaging healthy tissue on the way.</p><p></p><p>My solution:</p><p>1. Only have organic milk products, eat very little beef, and always try to eat organic grass fed beef when I do eat it. This does two things: good balance of Omega 3 to Omega 6 fatty acids (Omega 3 is [b]anti-inflammatory[/b] and Omega 6 is [b]inflammatory[/b]) plus there are no antibiotics killing off my [b]microbiome[/b]. The hormones added to feed-lot fed beef may also be a factor.</p><p>2.&#160;Drink filtered water to avoid chlorine.&#160;</p><p>3. Eat (in my cereal) some coconut oil a couple times a week. This kills off the candida in your gut to allow the healthy bacteria to propagate.</p><p>4. Take Krill oil (high in Omega 3, an anti-inflammatory)</p><p>5. Take Turmeric (anti-inflammatory)</p><p>6. Take probiotics. Probiotics are not all the same, so I read the labels and make sure I am getting a wide variety of strains in sufficient doses. I take more than one kind of probiotic, and put Trader Joe&#39;s plain kefir in my cereal because it has some strains I have not found anywhere else. I store the probiotics in my refrigerator to insure they stay alive.</p><p>7. Avoid sugar, because it is very hard on the [b]microbiome[/b]. This also is true of sugar substitutes, so get off of the soda of any kind, and don&#39;t eat candy. I know, ice cream is also bad, which is why I do not eat much any more.</p><p>8. Occasionally drink some organic bone broth to help heal [b]leaky gut[/b].</p><p>9. Eat raw pickles and raw sauerkraut&#160;to get additional probiotics (also found at Trader Joe&#39;s or Whole Foods)</p><p>10. Exercise - push-ups and sit-ups help with lower back pain, riding bike keeps the cardio vascular system healthy, hiking does the same.</p><p>11. Go to a chiropractor once a month or so to keep things aligned.</p><p>12. Eat prebiotics such as raw onions, garlic, etc to feed the [b]microbiome[/b]. Eat fiber. Inulin is fiber from Chicory and is especially good for helping the [b]microbiome[/b] thrive. This item is only last because it is the last thing I thought of while writing this terribly long sermon.</p><p></p><p>May you all get symptom relief in the very near future!</p><p></p><p>John</p>",

How long you were or have been involved with reactive rheumatism?\r\nim still battling it each and everyday. ive learned my limits and things that help and that dont. im 28 and cannot return to my normal life yet but i hope to within the next year. i am having a very hard time coming off prednisone...i taper down and then add more ibuprofen to feel less pain/inflammation which isnt a good trade off. im currently at 7mg prednisone daily and probably need to go on sulfasalazine, but i really dont want a heavy, lifelong drug if i can avoid it.\r\n\r\n5- what natural remedies and diet helps you\r\nacupuncture, massage meditation swimming physical therapy and an anti inflammatory diet and lots of rest. i need 10 hours a night to feel normal. yoga and stretching have surprisingly really hurt my body this year as ive tried to add them. some of my most excruciating pain has occured because i tried to do a 30 minute extremely simple yoga video or stretch. its a waiting game. i always felt those were right activities, i just wasnt ready. and i was right. after 10 months, i am now able to lightly stretch and feel better instead of worse.\r\n\r\none thing that happened both good and bad over the past year was that i had two trips i took. i went way up on my prednisone to get through them so it messed up my taper schedule. thats the bad part. the good part is that on 15 to 20 mg prednisone i got my body and muscles moving in ways i hadnt used since sick. it took a hit on my mood...changing my prednisone dosages is really hard on my emotions and sense of self. i get in a weird mental place unless i am on a dose for at least a week before changing, but dancing at a music festival with friends and scuba diving with my boyfriend....i wouldnt trade those experiences for anything, and i think ultimately, it allowed me to move forward in healing.",

I am HLAb27 positive, have recurring attacks (started S L O W L Y when I was about 6 yrs old; got worse after left college; I knew I should have stayed). I have taken most NSAIDs, myochrisine (gold), butasolidin (outlawed for horses (performance enhancer) before humans in the 1970s), motrin, aspirin, indocin (better than Celebrex and less deadly than Vioxx). I have used methotrexate (MTX) for the past 42 years except for a period when I started Enbrel (minimized pain but masked joint destruction). I started using MTX via pills but switched to subcu about eight years ago. I also show positive for sed rate, c-reactive-protein, creatinine, MCV, and anemia. After Enbrel, I have tried Otezla, Humira, Cosentyx, and now Remicade (fast acting ... took about six weeks to &quot;free-up&quot; my body from the waist down.</p><p>A few thoughts to what I have read quickly ... 1) I don&#39;t know how one can recover from arthritis ... maybe a relapse. 2) Once an HLAb27, always an HLAb27; it&#39;s hereditary 3) PROTECTED SEX ...REPEAT &#39;n&#39; times; getting gonorrhea and so on causes a reaction as do infections from the nose, stomach, lungs (pneumonia) from cuts to the skin (as in walking in dirty water with athletes foot). 4) join an arthritis support group, 5) do NOT stop MTX without making a personal diary noting no less than once a week where you note even subtle changes to joints, skin, pain, etc. I did NOT note then and did NOT realize that my arthritic &quot;crud&quot; grew on the outside of my right heel, that it grew in and around my left MCP, and that it made my TMJs hurt even more. So three operations, scrap the heel, replace MCP with carbon filament, replace both TMJs with titanium screws, inserts, bolts. NOW ... it seems that the AS has affected my entire spine enough so that I constantly feel tingling in my left hand, sometimes down my legs; the PsA has become slightly more active again on my feet (not a big change).</p><p>PS: I recently read an article about a &quot;unknowing&quot; couple that was trying to sue their doctor because MTX caused birth defects. Give me a break! How dumb can folks be? For the past 40 plus yrs I have always seen warnings about birth defects for both partners although not as bad as thalidomide (some research sees thalidomide as a potential cancer drug; gosh, does anyone wonder why? :-) ) google &quot;thalidomide cancer medicine&quot; and &quot;thalidomide celgene&quot;. I can be more detailed if necessary but not on-line. I hope this brief description helps someone. :-)</p>",

I took antibiotics for the food poisoning just after the hands started swelling, so I know my ReA is not caused by the antibiotics.\r\n I could also only eat plain bread/bagels for about 3 weeks after the food poisoning.\r\nI self diagnosed ReA as I quickly discovered that my Drs knew nothing about it, so thanks to google I sussed out that there is no cure, just relief. \r\nI had to practically beg for NSAID stronger than ibuprofen as I was borderline needing crutches. Now I have Naproxen the world is a much better place!\r\n\r\n2-did you have to take synovial fluid test?\r\nno tests, the Drs here (UK) seem to know little about ReA \r\n\r\n3- was anything visible in your MRI? My MRI is all ok.\r\nno tests, the Drs here (UK) seem to know little about ReA \r\n\r\n4-are you ok now? How long you were or have been involved with reactive rheumatism?\r\nI've had the odd few days where it felt like it was gone, but then it would come back again at varying severities, always worse in the morning or after being stationary for more than an hour.  \r\nWorst is when it hits my back as i can't then get out of bed.\r\nIf it goes in the soles of my feet (most common) it's annoying more than anything, as I can only shuffle about, but with a desk based job and collegues who can fetch coffee, it's not that bad as I can still join in with life.\r\nin the palms of the hands can be hard to deal with, as then it hurts to drive, open bottles/packets, and you just feel plain useless and at the mercy of everyone else. it really takes it's mental toll on you.\r\n\r\nin total i've had 2 weeks off work as a results of ReA, and many days working from home when I could not walk enough to get there. \r\n\r\n7 months on from the original infection and flare up, I have been 'clean' of Naproxen for 3 weeks :) My knuckles are often red but not worse then achy, everyday when I get up my feet are bright red and swolen but soon calm down, and my right foot has constant low level pain in a few toes. But overall not currently bad enough to need long term NSAID and the stomach risks that entails. \r\n\r\nit's Flu season here now and I have two small kids to bring desiese into the house, so I'm expecting another flare up soon and have a stockpile of Naproxen at the ready.\r\n\r\n5- what natural remedies and diet helps you?\r\nKeeping away from non processed dairy seems to help (pasturised milk on cereal causes gut issues in me which then make the ReA worse).\r\nI cannot stress enough how you need to keep moving in a flare up, as it helps keep the inflamation down (preventing tissue damage) and keeps your muscles strong. you just have to me measured in what you do.",

I also had pain in my elbow, back, and  wrist, but not swollen. I could not walk and the worst days I could not get out of bed. \r\n\r\nI am in a foreign country so when my blood showed high creatine I was flown to Dubai to see specialist since they thought I had kidney involvement.  I was started on steroids in febuary and ended in late march or early april. I still had minor pain,  but my blood was normal and I was told it was normal. In september I got pregnant and pain went away. \r\n\r\nLast October about 5 months after my son was born I started getting finger pain and swelling. My blood was normal. By May my back and ankle hurt. My blood was still normal. The pain is so much more minor than the initial reactive arthritis so i try not to complain, but the fatigue. I got a back MRI and showed sacroilitis. I was diagnosed with reactive spondyloarthritis.  They describe it as chronic reactive arthritis. I have been taking sulfasalazine a little more than a month, but it is still too early to tell. \r\n\r\n\r\nI was in the hospital with ear infection and mastoid inflammation so they think that was my cause or possibly the cold or flu I had leading to the ear infection. I took like 4 different types of antibiotics. Pills, IV, and injection. \r\n\r\nI did not have synovial fluid taken. \r\n\r\nNo MRI then since my inflammation was very obvious, MRI now shows inflammation and ultrasound shows tendon inflammation in ankle.\r\n\r\nI am not ok now. It is minor and I can walk. I am thankful everyday that i can walk, but I am not normal. \r\n\r\nI tried sugar free, dairy free,  gluten free diet, but it didn't work for me. I seem to improve when I go back to my home country for vacation though. ",

I have pain and inflammation in both of my feet, my middle finger on the right hand, and a bit in my knees. I have been getting steroid injections (prednisone) and taking DMARDS (Prednisone and Sulfasalazine) for about 3 months now with no real dramatic effect. I lost my job, couldn&#39;t attend my education and I am really at the end of my rope. I have talked to doctors about trying biologics but I am also scared of exposing my body to more extreme treatment. My CRP levels (Inflammatory markers) have gone down from 101 to around 40 so there has been some progress. But I have been stuck in the same place for a long time now and tried many alternative treatments (out of desperation) such as Applied Kinesiology, [b]Rolfing[/b] etc. I feel like all my doctors are saying different things and I simply don&#39;t know how to proceed.</p><p></p><p>PS: I had campylobacter-induced reactive arthritis in 2016 which lasted about two months. I got the same treatment but never really knew if I got better because of the medicine or just with time.</p><p></p><p>My questions are:</p><p></p><p>Does anyone have experience with Biologics? Are they dangerous?</p><p></p><p>Any other alternatives that I should try?</p><p></p><p>Has anyone had success with antibiotics?

I had loads of pain and stiffness in my left knee. It sounds like you have more classic symptoms than me as after about a year the pain spread into my heels, hips and back and I was rediagnosed with peripheral spondyloarthritis. I took sulfasalazine for around 5 months before being switched to methotrexate. Ask your doctor to prescribe you naproxen for pain relief as this helps me alot. I&#39;d also recommend you try and take up swimming as the more you exercise the joints the better you feel. Reactive arthritis typically takes around 6 months to go away so hang in there, it is extremely frustrating but you will get better. I&#39;ve been told that I will get biologics in 2 months time if I have not improved and I am going to take them as I&#39;ve been suffering for over a year now. </p><p></p><p>Good luck!</p><p></p><p>M</p>",

Many have side effects if you take them longer term (e.g. the steroid Predisone can cause obesety)</p><p></p><p>As per other poster, I really find that Naproxen helps, as it kicks in within 15 minutes and gives relief for around 12 hours before dropping off. just remember to always take it with food, and ideally a protein pump inhibitor (Omazerpole) to protect the stomach from the Naproxen.&#160; After the Naproxen has got me moving, moderate exercise really does help reduce the overall symptoms.</p><p></p><p>insofar as I can tell, there is no #cure# for ReA, only management of symptoms during a flare up.

You need to stay positive.. with my genetic makeup and the triggering disease i was told this might never improve, but it did. \u00a05 months in, i am now only having pain a few days a week, and though i still limp a little bit i am able to work, study and work out.",

                    "post": "Axel, Well, join the boat!!! I have had Reiter's Syndrome for sixty plus years. I am HLaB27 positive. At first my parents, who really didn't care, said I was having \"growing pains\". My ankles would swell if I walked on the concrete streets of New York City for too long (usually with my mother as she went shopping). It was not until I was about 15 or so that I got a stomach bug during the summer while skiing at altitude (probably giarardia). Anyway, about two months later I got stiff. It lasted for two years off and on. I experienced irregular swelling on both sides of my spine plus some lethargy. When Sonny Liston and Ali fought in Lewiston, ME I was in the infirmary with German measles. I was taking lots of aspirin to reduce the fever. As soon as I got out of the infirmary, I did a cross-country ski race; the coach said if I did not race in the practice I could not ski for the team that weekend. I raced faster than another boy for one loop who went to the Junior Nationals, but tired somewhat on the second. The coach was impressed; however, the next day I was back in the infirmary with the flu. I was able to stay in high school (not that big a challenge).\r\n\r\nI had a more significant attack during my junior year in college. My hips and lower bag started to hurt so much that it was difficult to ski, especially on ice! Each chatter of the skis sent some pain shooting through my hips. I spent a few weeks on crutches when it got bad but taking some aspirin seemed to help.\r\n\r\nTwo years after I left college my girlfriend's son gave me strep throat. Within two months my body started to ache, slowly at first. First, it was the ankles swelling (I thought it was a long bike ride). Then, the rest of the body tightened up. I started taking Indocin and aspirin for several months. Since that did not provide much relief my doctor (an internist) sent me to his med school rheumatologist. He tried sulfasalazine, butazolidine (banned for many years, but banned first in horses). Gradually, the attack subsided.\r\n\r\nTwo more years later I got cellulitis in my left knee. I went to the hospital for IV anti-biotics. Two weeks after that I woke up with incredible pain throughout most of my body.  My rheumatologist put me on methotrexate (MTX), 9 tabs, 3 mg each, weekly). That gradually brought my sed rate down from over 100 to about 75 in maybe two months. That rate gradually diminished over the next four months. Its side effects were nausea, headaches, and sores in my mouth and nose. I put an anti-biotic cream on those sores to prevent infection. I also smoked some week to reduce the nausea and help my appetite. I had lost 14 pounds in two weeks following the initial infection. The attack lasted about nine months.\r\n\r\nI tried Enbrel without MTX for about nine years. That was a BIG mistake as the Enbrel hid the progression of Reiter's Syndrome (RS).  Its effect was that I had to get my left MCP replaced, my right ankle scoped, and my right shoulder scoped.  Then, six years ago I had both TMJs replaced.\r\n\r\nI have tried Humira, Cosentyx, and Simponi. None worked. I tried Otezla; it didn't work as expected but I got somewhat depressed (one of its side effects). I tried prednisone again (after a thirty years hiatus). I got very angry with my dog so I stopped that. I am now taking Remicade every four weeks at an intermediate level of dosage. I started it after I had had my most recent attack that lasted about 15 months (my neck got terribly inflamed; muscles and tendons swollen and tight). After the third treatment I noticed some improvement; I could walk much better without feeling every bone in my spine jarring with each step.\r\n\r\nUntil 2016 I have been able to keep a somewhat active lifestyle although very diminished from what it might have been. The last two years have been a real \"downer\" as the anklylosing spondylitis became severe; C3-C5 are fused, C1 only exists as a shadow, several back vertebra are close to fusion; however, my spinal canal remains \"OK\" although somewhat narrow in one place.\r\n\r\nI credit my good fortune to a few good doctors, to an active lifestyle (even when it hurts), and to avoiding infections. My social life is abysmal as people are all too quick to notice my stiff posture and lack of flexibility. Women, understandably, do not want to be with someone who has an inherited disease and, honestly, I don't want to pass HLAb-27 onto anybody. On the bright side, I have not gotten any STDs that increase the risk of another arthritic attack.\r\n\r\nBottom line: do as much research as  you can, take personal notes (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, weight via spreadsheets) especially when you have attacks; the doctors love 'em; the documentation drives them \"wild\" and after you start a new med (I didn't think of that until recently). Stay as active as you can; walk, swim, bike; avoid running but try hill-bounding (see: https://cxcacademy.wordpress.com/tag/bounding/). \r\n",

            "post": "i am a 45 year old lady who worked as a healthcare assistant in derriford hospital until june of last year when i was dismissed from my post due to my incapability of being able to fullfill my role following what i beleive to be a reactive arthritis following the flu and swine flu vaccination. I have never felt so ill or felt so much pain in all my life. I had profuse swelling of my hands legs and feet, they were that swollen the consultant at the hospital said he has never seen anything like it. i experienced severe pain in my head and in multiple joints and i lost alot of my mobility. I went from being very active to being able to do virtually nothing. I have had numerous tests blood test to check for rheumatoid etc echocardial gram, ultrasound on all my internal organs and doctors could find nothing. i was in that much pain at one point i wanted to die. Doctors put me on all sorts of medication including morphein and i was still in agony. The only thing i responded to was steroids but the consultant took me off them as i had no immflamatory markers in my blood which suggested i dint need to be on steroids. Within days all my symptons were backand in the end i could stick it no longer so i put myself back on them, went back to the doctor where they were shocked at the significant change in me and agreed to keep me on them. I still as of yet do not have a diagnosis and i am a year on. I feel that the vaccinations i was given has been the cause of this and the fact they gave me a double dose at a time when i was full of cold and cough , doctors feel my immune has become overloaded and couldnt cope , in turn causing my immune to attack my body.  :cry: i feel very concerned as i am now a year on and everytime i try stopping the steroids all my symptons come back. They never go away properly i am still swollen and in pain but not as bad as when im not on steroids. I wonder how my body has been affected longterm and the damage this has caused. Is there anybody else experienced similarities to myself i would love to hear from others[color=red:786da7d458][/color:786da7d458]",

I have had all the blood tests come back negative bone scans etc.\r\nGave up with the Doctors because they did not diagnose me and just prescribed various anti inflamatories that never worked\r\nA year ago I caught a really bad vomitting bug at work and within 4 weeks all my joints were aching/stiff, I had a terrible itch on my arms and legs which I scratched untill they bled, shooting pains at the back of my ankles up into my calf, horrendous. Like you the pain was so bad I couldn't take it and could not face the pain. I was put on steroids and Yes i felt the best I had in 8 years. Now off them and back to all the sympoms although not as bad. I went private in the end and was diagnosed but it seems GP's do not seem to appreciate how bad this condition is. My sister has Rheumatoid and gets all the help drugs she needs. I however have given up and just put up with the bad days and enjoy the good. I also had to quit work.\r\nI had other symptoms such as sudden urges to pass urine, saw itchy eyes with blurred vision but most of all the joint pain, being unable to walk and feeling really crap.

                    "post": "Hi,\r\nI am a 40 year old woman and have had reactive arthritis for four years on and off.\r\nThe first time I had it was after I caught 'slapped cheek syndrome (parvovirus) from one of my 3 children. The first time I had reactive arthritis I was really very poorly, and like so many of the other comments from other people, I had very little help from my gp, in fact I diagnosed my illness myself after several months of suffering. \r\nSince my first time it seems to come back almost yearly, each time leaving me with another problem joint. I have had it again this time since Jan and I have been so bad this time that I can barely face getting out of bed some days (rather difficult with 3 children).\r\nI find it difficult to explain how I feel, other than in pain and feeling so dreadfully ill ALL of the time.\r\nMy husband found this site for me, I am hoping that by sharing info,  I might be able to find something that will now make my life easier.\r\nI have tried diclofenac, which did help me at first, but this time it has seemed to do nothing. \r\nIn Feb I was so bad that I insisted that the rheumatology dep saw me at my worst, as in the past by the time I saw them I was in remission. I had an intramuscular steroid injection, which has helped, but I am still getting really bad spells.They x-rayed me and did the blood tests when I was really bad, which showed that my CRP was raised to 21, when previously it had been showing normal at less than 5. I have also had iron and folic acid deficiency each time. I would advise anyone to be really persistant with gp's and even do what I did and cut out the middle man and phone up hospital direct. I now have it in black and white a diagnosis for my gp (who still won't really accept it!) Plus permission for the gp to give me the injection there if I need it.\r\nI was trying out naproxin for a while with tramadol for bed time (I sometimes really struggle to move and get in and out of bed) but the naproxen started making me feel really sick, so I have spent the last few days in a really emotional state, crying. As other people have said 'this has ruined my life' I am usually an outgoing person, but am so afraid that this will get worse and worse throughout my life, I just want to feel 'normal' again and play with my children like other people do.\r\nI too would love to hear from others, because how ever nice people are, I think only another person with this can really understand.[color=indigo:4a12c5af66][/color:4a12c5af66]",

Over the course of these few weeks I saw many doctors and was fianlly diagnosed with nodular scleritis associated with rheumatic autoimmune disease. The doctor said something triggered the disease in me but cannot prove it was the flu shot. It appears obvious to any rational mind that the flu shot was the trigger. Documented cases of the flu shot causing this since the seventies. Educate yourself about the true risks of the flue shot before getting one. No one informed me of these risks.",

            "post": "<p>Hi everyone,</p><p></p><p>I became ill nearly a year ago to the day and so I thought I would share my experience of Reactive Arthritis with you. &#160;I don&#39;t share a lot on social media, and have never posted in a forum in my life, but to &quot;celebrate&quot; this odd anniversary here goes nothing...</p><p></p><p>Before last November I was a very physically active 34-year-old woman with a stressful career and busy social life.&#160;</p><p></p><p>It took 6 weeks to get a conclusive diagnosis, during which time I was the most ill I had ever been in my life with what I now know to be classic Reactive Arthritis symptoms - pain in all my joints and tendons from the hips down making walking more than 10 steps very difficult, extreme fatigue, inflammatory temperatures, mind fogs, sensation of a UTI, bloodshot red raw but weeping eyes, extreme dry mouth, trouble breathing etc. etc. &#160;</p><p></p><p>During those weeks, and once I received a diagnosis, I was terrified. &#160;Terrified I&#39;d never get better. &#160;Terrified I&#39;d never walk normally again. Terrified I&#39;d never be able to go back to work. &#160;Terrified I&#39;d never be able to swim, or run, or dance again. &#160;Terrified I&#39;d never be able to have children. &#160;The list went on. &#160;</p><p></p><p>I spent quite a lot of time in bed on the internet looking for answers, my faith in my doctors having been severely shaken by my experiences in the weeks without diagnosis of constantly being sent away, at best being told to rest and come back if things failed to improve, or at worse being looked at almost as if my symptoms were psychosomatic. I wanted to know: &#160;Why had this happened to me? &#160;(Answer, doctors never did establish the infection that triggered my immune system&#39;s inappropriate response.) &#160;What was my prognosis? And what could I do to make myself better, as nothing doctors were giving me (anti-inflammatories and steroids)&#160;were doing much good? &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p></p><p>I wanted to tell you all that, a year on, I am better. &#160;</p><p></p><p>It been a long road. &#160;You&#39;ll all know how Reactive Arthritis works so as you can imagine there&#39;s been lots of ups and downs. &#160;I was discharged by the consultant after 6 months but I&#39;d say it&#39;s only the past few months I&#39;ve started to feel 100%.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is different and so what worked for me may not be the same for you but I thought I would share what I found helpful. &#160;</p><p></p><p>I read online that some people had found acupuncture helpful. &#160;I&#39;ve never held too much truck with alternative therapies, and was scared of needles. &#160;But I was so desperate to try anything to get back to &quot;normal&quot; I booked an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist. &#160;When the first needle went into my foot I felt a pleasant rushing sensation down my leg. Where there had been pain and discomfort was suddenly energised and I was converted. &#160;I went weekly for months and I believe, along with time, and other changes detailed below, it has helped me to recover. &#160;&#160;</p><p></p><p>Once the flare ups started to get further apart, and I had a bit more energy between flares, I bit the financial bullet and joined a gym with a sauna and steam room. &#160;I found the heat of the sauna especially helpful, both with the dreadful cold aches in my bones I had almost continually and with loosening the tendons in my legs. &#160;</p><p></p><p>About 3 months in I went to see a hydrotherapist and got a set of exercises I could do in the gym pool myself, which I tried to do once a week for just 10 minutes. &#160;</p><p></p><p>When I felt like I had more energy, about 4 months in, I cautiously started aqua aerobics classes once a week. &#160;I told the instructor about my condition and she was brilliant and stopped me from overdoing it. &#160;(The temptation to push myself too hard in an attempt to feel like I was normal again was something I have battled with during my recovery.) &#160;Even though I struggled, had to take a lot of rests during the class, and hobbled out of the pool at the end, the sensation of having done something physical, however minor compared to what I used to do, was such a psychological boost.</p><p></p><p>As my energy levels increased, I started to go to aqua aerobics a couple of times a week. &#160;And then I found a very gentle [b]Iyengar yoga[/b] class, and started going to that too. &#160;Although I had to block out the fact that I was clearly much, much less physically able than other people in the class that were more than twice my age, stretching the tendons in my legs seemed to help with my mobility a lot. &#160;The yoga classes also helped me to quiet down the terror I felt.</p><p></p><p>I read a lot about diet, and, although I didn&#39;t follow the strict elimination diet recommended by some, I did find there were certain things that did increased my inflammation: mainly red meat, sugar (both natural and processed) and caffeine so I avoided them (although wasn&#39;t puritanical). &#160;Now having given up caffeine, I&#39;m not going back!</p><p></p><p>But over the past year I would say my recovery has only been in part thanks to these physical activities. &#160;My state of mind has been equally important. &#160;In the first months, whenever I thought about, and so became distressed about the future, an inflammatory fever spike would happen that I could chart with a thermometer. &#160;This made me realise that my mind and my body were not two entities but part of the same system. &#160;Sounds obvious but this is not how the medical profession was treating me. &#160;And so, that&#39;s why I would recommend yoga and acupuncture (I have since started gardening which is gentle enough and relaxing too). &#160;</p><p></p><p>I would like to say if you too are stressing about your future, there is hope. &#160;Celebrate even the smallest advances you make - even if it&#39;s just getting out of bed to have a bath. &#160;Coping with Reactive Arthritis is really hard and probably no one you know even knows what it is. &#160; Please give yourself a break. &#160;Don&#39;t beat yourself up. &#160;Be kind to yourself.</p><p></p><p>You can do it!</p>",

She says that anger and fear are stored in the body and until theyre properly released through meditation, &#160;complete healing cannot occur. I am American, currently living in Australia, and theres something here called acuenergetics. I will start it next week but I believe its basically [b]Barbara Allen[/b]&#39;s theory mixed with the concept of (not the practice of) acupuncture. So in the way that acupuncture takes the chi of your body and manipulates it to restore balance, so does acuenergetics, teaching you through meditation to re-balance the energy trapped in your body which is one reason we experience this arthritis.</p><p></p><p>Im explaining this because I wonder what you and anyone else thinks. Was this a piece of your recovery process? I really dont know what to believe. I can imagine it being true for me - i do have some past negativity to probably work through, but doesnt everyone, sick or not? and i know the obvious answer is &quot;ok, just try it, work to meditate on it and see if it helps. why does it matter to know first if everyone believes it?&quot; &#160;It makes me pause that [b]Barbara Allen[/b] AND these acuenergetics practitioners are promoting their ideas as The True Way. They say this piece of mental cleansing is essential to get better, but maybe it only is for them. Maybe a lot of people can benefit from slowing down and meditating but energy being trapped inside isnt necessarily true for all. I dont know....i guess I just feel a little cautious of my emotional state right now - Im hesitant to start telling myself &quot;you dont process your emotions and balance them well and thats partially why youre so sick.&quot; i dont want to kick myself when Im already down if these peoples theory is actually just coincidence and *happens* to work for a lot of people , isnt necessarily based in evidence or fact.</p><p></p><p>Does that all make sense?

I was also affected to reactive arthritis about 1 1/2 years ago, spent 10 days in the hospital with no diagnosis, and left in a wheelchair, my legs swollen double their size. Like you, my faith in doctors was severely shaken. &#160;But, while everyone is different, I found many of the things you did very useful in my own recovery. Acupuncture was amazing in its ability to help me walk again after just several sessions. Physical therapy and massage were also extremely helpful. Because of the intense pain, I took pain meds for close to 2 months, but was able to gradually stop them and took turmeric and omega3 to lessen inflammation. I also took a range of supplements. Because I didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for a few months, I did not do steroids or any of the &quot;normal&quot; protocols.</p><p>Because of the severe damage to my leg muscles, I found I needed a broad range of exercises to bring them back-yoga, weights, squats, lifts (I believe it has to do with short and long muscle fiber), but was finally able to be running again after about six months.</p><p>You also talk about mental state and diet which I&#39;ve also come to see as very important. Meditation is helpful. I also had my first flare up recently, which turned out to be only several weeks in duration without the swelling and intense pain of the first occurrence. At its start, I was rigorous in eating an anti inflammatory diet (mine was no lectin; developed by Dr Steven [b]Gundry[/b]), and I think this perhaps helped prevent a more serious flare up.&#160;</p><p>It is a long road, but with patience and focus everyone should know there can be a positive ending. Every day I run my couple miles I&#39;m filled with gratitude because for many months I didn&#39;t feel it would ever be possible again.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p>",

Cortisol is not released in high amounts and is therefore not very active during the night. This is one of the reasons inflammation processes thrive at nighttime. Both because your body&#39;s natural inflammation fighter cortisol is not active, and beacuse energy-craving cytokines (peptides driving parts of the inflammation process) will have more fuel to consume and be very active as your muscles are not expending much energy when you sleep.</p><p></p><p>Some doctors think it would be better to take Prednisolone in the middle of the night to, simply put, provoke active levels of cortisol during the night time. You&#39;ll find interesting studies on this online if you look for it.</p><p></p><p>So far these studies show that the effect is first and foremost related to improving stiffness which often follow the nocturnal pain of ReA, it doesn&#39;t seem to help so much with the pain itself.</p><p></p><p>You should talk to your doctor about any changes in medication, or your medication routine, and never change medications or take your medications in other ways or at other times than what your doctor have told you. There can be unwanted (difficulty sleeping) and even dangerous (your body will later be unable to release cortisol in a natural way) consequenses from taking Prednisolone at night.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to painkillers that could help you, you are currently taking Metrotrexate, which limits your options a bit. I find the best pain relief from NSAIDs, but they are not an option for you as they can interact with Metrotexate in potentially dangerous ways, so you should not use them. But your doctor might be able to help you find better alternatives if the ones you are taking at the moment aren&#39;t effective.</p><p></p><p>Take care. Many people suffering from ReA find great relief in Metrotexate as soon as it kicks in.</p>",

I did end up splitting my pred dose and taking it 12 hours apart. I have done so much research and never read that explanation for night flares so really helpful. The insomnia side effect of taking it before bed wasn&#39;t relevant as I was in too much pain to sleep regardless. At least I got a few hours this way. Now down to 12.5mg and dropping but the side effects have been hideous. Gained 13kg in 3 months and my face looks like a puffer fish haha!! </p><p>I have ceased all painkillers now as my liver function dropped. I am walking without crutches and doing water physio etc and changed up my diet as well. My inflammatory markers were at 186 when I was hospitalised, my last bloodwork they were at 4!

They doubled my methotrexate to 20mg about 6 weeks ago and things improved from there. </p><p>I ended up developing tracheal stenosis from an emergency intubation in February.

One of the worst things about ReA is the fact that it\u2019s quite rare, and it can be difficult to learn about the experiences of others.\r\n\r\nVery glad you have had success with Metotrexate, it\u2019s a powerful drug that helps a lot of people.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s encouraging to hear that you are so much better, as I will start taking Metotrexate myself next week. I have had this for 8 weeks and treatment so far have been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI was put on NSAIDs at first, and they were great for pain relief, but did nothing for the swelling. Cortisone injections didn\u2019t help either. Oral steroids had a small effect, but not enough to be able to throw away the crutches.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHaha... i know what you mean. I tried to prepare for the prednisolone weight gain by never having more food around than needed, but you get so hungry from taking them i found myself begging friends and my girlfriend to bring extra food :)\r\n\r\nI am HLA B27 positive and my doc said i have to prepare for a chronic course though he will be aggressive in his approach to treat this, so I will fight on and find comfort in stories like yours.\r\n\r\nThe best of luck with your health, hope the current problems you are experiencing turns out well."

            "post": "<p>Hello,</p><p>&#160;</p><p>I have been reading the stories of reactive arthritis and i thought that i would share mine. It all started 3 1/2 years ago with urethritis and all the classic symptoms that go with an STD after a one night stand. I went in to urgent care 3 different&#160;times over many&#160;months&#160;and was treated with azithromycin (1g oral) and ceftazidime (injections). Each time the tests for GC&#160;would be negative and the same&#160;symptoms would return within about 2 weeks.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I lived with this for many months until i went to my primary physician. He said that because the tests for STDs were negative that I needed to go to a urologist. So i made an appointment for the urologist. I go to the urologist and tell her my story. She orders many lab tests over many different visits, UA/UC, GC, CBC, ESR, CRP, mycoplasma, lymes, etc. to all of which came back&#160;negative. &#160;</p><p></p><p>I was put on Bacterim for a month, that didnt provide any results. I was put on Doxycycline for a month, that did nothing. She insisted that i see&#160;a different urologist.</p><p></p><p>I go to the other urologist and was told that there is nothing wrong with me and that the symptoms are all in my head. He said that if there is something there, there is not a test for it and we cannot treat for it and that throwing different antibiotics at it was not the way to treat me. I was very upset about this becasue i have been getting the &#39;its all&#160; in your head&#39; line from 2 other doctors. But they dont know how it feels.</p><p></p><p>So now it has been over three years of living with the constant urethrits symptoms (urgency,&#160;drainage, constant wet feeling, prickly,&#160;uncomfortable)&#160;which has made my life aweful. I figure that i will have to live like this for the rest of my life, increasing depression and diminishing thoughts of having a normal social and personal relationships.</p><p></p><p>About three months ago, i started to develop early morning back pain. I was waking up 2-3 in the am and unable to lay down any longer. I would&#160; get up and sleep sitting up on the couch or chair. I got to the point of going to see a chiropracter to se what was going on. It felt like there was a tendon that crossed my spine and needed to be put back where it needed to be. My back has been very tight and tender for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Chiropracter saw me for 3 sessions and told me that there was no misallignment of my back and that he didnt feel further care would be benificial and that he couldnt help me. He told me to go to the doctor.</p><p></p><p>So i make an appointment to go see the doctor this was a month ago. The day before I go into the doctor, my knee was aching. The next day it is swollen up a balloon. I have never had anything like this before.</p><p></p><p>I went to my doctors appointment, just a random doctor, and she takes xrays of my knee and back. She says that these came back normal and that i should see my normal doc for a follow up. In the mean time to ice and elevate my knee. So a week later, i go to my doctor. He orders a bunch of rehmatology tests, crp, esr, lymes, rf, ccp, ana, and also another GC test. Also, a MRI was scheduled for my knee. I am already a known HLA B27 positive.</p><p></p><p>MRI of knee was negative. all the other tests were negative (crp and esr were slightly elevated). But i was positive for chylamidia. At this point I was excited to finally have a positive for something!!!</p><p></p><p>Doc puts me on 1g azithromycin and 7 days doxycycline. He says that I have reiters syndrome or reactive arthritis. its been 2 weeks now, and im not sure the antibiotics&#160;have&#160;worked at all. I still feel like i can feel the urethritis lingering around.</p><p></p><p>Back to my knee. My left knee has been swollen since that day 1 month now. I had the fluid drained off of it and steroid injected, and it swelled back up the next day. Since then my 3rd toe on the left foot has been swollen up and is very sensitive. Makes it almost unbearable to walk.</p><p></p><p>I try to keep stretching by legs as much as posible as they have become increasingly stiff, mostly the tendons behind my knee. I have my good days and bad days for sure. This is a very dehabiliitating disease as i am a very active person and i like to keep busy. I have never sat around on the couch as much as i have this past month.</p><p></p><p>I am trying to stay positive, but it is difficult. I have missed out on many activities that i enjoy doing already, and fear I will miss more throughout the winter. Its hard enough to even go to work.</p><p></p><p>And now, my other knee is starting to ache.</p><p></p><p>But that is my story.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It has been one month since my</p>",

If what you have is chlamydia, you should have been put on at least a month long course of antibiotics (azithromycin potentially in combination with something else).

Everything started with a salmonella infection, which I never related to be the trigger of the arthritis. It took the doctors a year and a half to figure it out. Tons of tests and no positive answers, I know what you are going through, I really do. Until finally I got to see a doctor with a bit of common sense and he sent me to a rheumatologist. I went from a normal state to a wheel chair in six months, few weeks after having the salmonella infection. The inflamation started in my toes and went up to my ankle, both knees, hips, lower back, cervicals. The rheumatologist, thank God, figured it out, diagnosed me with reactive arthritis and prescribed a treatment based on methotrexate, cortisone and sulfasalazine. Three weeks after I was walking again. It has been difficult during all these years, because the arthritis comes and goes, but I git to maintained stable. Everyone is different, but you should look into a similar treatment if the couse is a reactive arthritis. I have a friend who did not do well with the methotrexate, but instead reacted well to Humira. He is doing fine as well. I hope this help to look into a different treatment and give more hope.",

Two years ago he started experiencing shoulder pain and swelling, and it would cause his entire arm to swell and turn almost purple. It was extremely painful. After seeing several specialists, having steroid injections done and trying medications, he was finally referred to a Rheumatologist. They didn&#39;t even care to see him once they saw how young he is. They basically told him they didn&#39;t want to waste their time on him because anyone in their 20s wouldn&#39;t be having RA or severe arthritis issues. Cut to current time, and his knee has swollen up, pops out of joint and causes his lower leg to swell. Every single doctor he has seen has no clue what&#39;s wrong with him, and a different RA doctor brushed him off again. He&#39;s now having back issues, his other knee is starting to have pain and he&#39;s extremely tired all of the time.  His father has M.S., and has plenty of relatives who have RA and other similar medical conditions.  I guess my question is, for those of you who are in your 20s or 30s, how did you get a doctor to take you seriously? And a question for everyone is what do you do to help cope with the joint pain?  I&#39;m not dead set on him having any form of arthritis, but he has so many of the symptoms that I don&#39;t want to rule it out. Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",

Be patient and let it subside over time. &#160;I am still exercising but to a lesser extent. &#160;I haven&#39;t run for almost a month but have been a regular on the Stair Master. &#160;I really appreciate you sharing your insight and knowledge. &#160;This is ver helpful! &#160;- &#160;Kelly</p>"

Diagnosed by a rheumatologist and treated with Quinoric (couldn&#39;t tolerate other drugs) and steroids for years. Huge swollen lower joints initially, permanently damaged joints now. When I lie down it takes quite a while for my body to settle into the bed and it feels like I have lumps on joints and then moving in the night is difficult I have to grab the headboard to help me to turn and joints grate/stuck to each other. In the early days getting up was excruciating but that has improved quite a bit. Still on daily prescription pain mess but only minimal now. If it is reactive it will need treating to try and get rid of it as soon as possible and avoid permanent joint damage like I have. Lots of people do manage to get rid of it quite quickly, hope you are one of the lucky ones.</p>",

Difficult to move , really stiff all over, muscles, joints. \r\nWhen home a couple of  days later saw my GP, He thought I had Polymyalgia Reumatica, put me on Predisolone 40 mg. within 2 hours pain gone !\r\nI Have been trying since to come off the PRED. but keep hitting pain barriers and have to up the dose to stop the  intense pain.\r\nI was refered to a Rhematologist , advised initial appoint ment could be up to a year so went private! The rhemy was a bit vague and thought it was Reactive Arthritis and sent me away with an anti inflamatory  drug and reduction plan for the pred. He said it should all settle down in about 6 months! \r\nwhen it didnt went back to see him ( NHS)had blood tests for various things , all negative. He did say I have fluid in my left leg. He was still a bit vague on the dx.  long story short. He discharged me a year later with no definitive dx. without telling me!\r\nCurrently seeing another rheumy,  again negative blood tests Still have fluid in left leg, She(rheumy ) says she is unable to  give me a dx. until I come of the pred.  She put me on a reduction plan which I followed to the letter but again hit a pain wall which is way to painful to overcome.\r\nSo have had to increase my pred dose from 3 mg ( when I hit the pain barrier back up to 10 mg SO FAR as still in pain!!!\r\nDont think Rheumy is going to be very happy, but pain is outrageous when I hit the wall.\r\nHow is  it possible to get past the pain?\r\nWhat do I tell the Rheumy? \r\nHow do I get a reliable dx.\r\nIm on cocodomol (15mg) 8 a day.\r\nArcoxia, and when required 5 mg diazepam.\r\nI havent any visible swelling, but skin around left foot feels tight as fluid drains down. left knee was very painful before upping the pred.\r\nknee also has fluid in ( per my GP). \r\nDont seem to be getting anywhere, Rhemys are very hard to see .\r\nWould appreciate any suggestions.\r\nThanks in anticipation,\r\nTony.",

Personally, my infection was chlamydia. &#160;Some other common ways to get ReA is infection to the bladder or intestines. &#160;</p><p></p><p>I started feeling symptoms 1 week after being infected with chlamydia. &#160;My first symptom was a skin rash. &#160;The rash mainly occured on my elbows and knuckles. &#160;The unbearable pain started 2 weeks after infection, in my neck and later spread to my jaw, shoulder, elbow, knee, lower back, ankle, toes, foot, and breastbone. &#160;I suffered for 3 months and went through 8 different doctors before I was diagnosed with ReA. &#160;I went to my family physician, 3 walk in clinics, chiropractors, physio therapist, and a hospital until I found my answer. &#160;</p><p></p><p>I am very please with my phyisician, Dr. Diane Lacaille (Vancouver BC), giving me valuable information and medication. I have tried many different medications and the most effective I have found for myself are Methotrexate, Sulphasalazine, and Indomethacin. &#160;In 2 months Methrotrexate has lowered my C Reactive Protein from 56% to 15%. &#160;CRP is normally at a range of &gt;1%, 1%-3% is high risk, 7% is significant active inflammation. &#160;Some forums I have read on ReA, some patients blood tests showed up to 190% CRP.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Now, I have been suffering from ReA for almost 9 months. &#160;My condition has gotten better and I am optimistic. &#160;Throughout those long months and countless tears, it is easy to get depressed and ask God &quot;why me?&quot;, but sooner or later you&#39;ll have to get up and return to daily activities. &#160;I feel it is VERY important to move and loosen up your joints. &#160;Avoid staying in one position as it will stiffen your joints. &#160;It may be painful and unrealistic in the beginning, but as soon as you can, get up and move.

In July, it was mostly in my hips, knees, sternum, and ankle. By August, most of the hip and ankle pain had dissipated but it started in my heels. Now, it is in my clavicle, my heels, and my knees mostly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne thing I would recommend is staying the course with the NSAIDs that your doc prescribes you. I think the reason it spread to my clavicle was because I was trying to taper myself off the NSAIDs, but they help a lot in keeping inflammation levels down and I suspect would prevent the spread to other body parts.\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Thomas.",

I&#39;m 41 and looking after the kids/paying for their needs on my own for the most part. I have continued to be an active mother throughout my experience of the disease, but thankfully my kids have stepped up to help with bringing shopping in and putting it away ect. There were times that I was unable to hold more than 800grams in my hand because my wrists couldn&#39;t hold the weight! Even taking the wet washing out of the washing machine was difficult.</p><p></p><p>I sprained my right ankle one week before onset of ReA back in June 2017. Nothing to do with the ReA except that my ankle has only recently returned to normal size (has been swollen and delicate for 4 months!).</p><p></p><p>I woke up one day in early June with ALL of the joints on the right side of my body swollen and sore. My fingers and toes, knee etc and ball of foot.</p><p>I thought it was a strange reaction to the sprain... </p><p>I thought that would be the worst of it.</p><p>Over the next few days I found the rest of my body followed and I was swollen in every joint in my body. Although my neck and shoulders were fine.</p><p>I went to the doctor after a week and he suggested that it was reactive arthritis. His suggestion was that I take ibuprofen regularly as described on the box and paracetamol when the pain was bad. The two can be taken simultaneously as long as you take them in the recommended doses. This recommendation from my doctor suited me. I prefer to try the simple option before engaging in more difficult drugs.</p><p>Somehow I managed to get through life during the following 4 months... I ended up having to take a lot of time off work... Almost four weeks if you put the days together. Some days I could get out of bed, send the boys to school and make myself go to work. Other days I would force myself out of bed, send the boys off to school and almost collapse in pain!</p><p>After about 3 months the effects of ReA started to recede. I visited Alice Springs just as the ReA seemed to be diminishing and was able to climb Telegraph Hill (a rocky outcrop in the centre of Australia with loads of uneven rocky steps). I was amazed! Just three weeks before that and I wouldn&#39;t have even thought about trying.</p><p>My ReA has not gone away. I still have pain in my wrist if I use it to push my body up. I still have pain in my feet. And I still can&#39;t sleep or spend time with my elbows or knees bent... I used to go to sleep with my hand near my face, I now have to sleep with my arm extended to at least a right angle. If I don&#39;t do that I feel pain in my elbow and wrist within minutes.</p><p>I recently went to a physiotherapist to ask him to help me strengthen my wasted muscles. Neither of us realised how little I have been using my muscles and so I did too much on the first try. </p><p>Please remember to take advantage of any time you can when you have reactive arthritis to do strengthening excerises. It hurts, but if you don&#39;t you will end up like me. Starting from the beginning. I used to play volleyball. I had really strong legs. After doing 20mins of strengthening excerises they still feel like hot steel three days later! Keep up some sort of strengthening excerises in legs, wrists and core so that you can walk away from this body attack with an ability to get back to normal!!!</p><p>Rxx</p>",

But i know i have Reaktive arthrisis from everything that has happened since i got a unspesified uretritt from mycoplasma genitalia in 2014 and my doctor never sent me to further investigaton and hen got the wrong treatment(sorry for the bad english) I just feel like noone belives me since my symptomes have Been quite calm and spread out over the years and i have been pregnant inbetween so my doctor blames it on me just been tired and stressed. I also work AS a tattooist and have not connected all the syptoms(shoulder pain, hands. Neck, hips and general bodypains) together before i got uveitt and urethrit,, Then shortly after stomack infection. Extreme fatigue, back, hip pains, mouthulsers, skin itching, pain in eyes. Before this in 2014 4-5 months after the decease i got hippains and fatige(bit blamed it on the pregnancy ofcourse) but the hippains dissapaired after awhile and i was fine untill the end of pregnancy When the hips hit me hard again(again hard to say if that actually just was the pregnancy) but then it shouldnt have just come and go like that(?) then after the birth a month my knee hurt and swell up and lasted a long time, my doctor just said it was a swollen slimebag and it will go over. I didnt think much of it and just kept at living, i had a hard time with the baby, little sleep and trouble with nursing so pretty stressed and didnt connect the dots, i notised though that i was more tired than i should in that time and i tried to figure out what it was and our nabours wall to wall was bothered whit alot of mould/fungus so i figured that it might be that i was allergic to that and we actually moved because of it. oh.. loong story and many detailes later, i am now 100% sure i have reaktive arthrisis and i am very scared that my girl was borned while i had a active mycoplasma genitalia infection. I dont feel understood or belived from my doctor Even though ive been sent to koloskopi, urolog and revmatologist but noone can really SEE or prove anything. I am hla 27 positive, my granddad had bektherev and arthrisis and my mom has many bodyaces but no diagnosiS. My doctor just thinks i might started a bektherew but my body fits into rea ! Uveitt urethit, swollen knee. My hands and feet have lack of strenght, their warm and feel swollen in the mornings, my hips stiffens up while i sit and i walk like a fat chicken before they loosen up. My body feels like its full of puss. They didnt find anything at the other specialists because When i First got there those symptoms where over. Know i dont know what to do other than try continue the doctor to give me time of work and go to homeopath and other alternatives or go to some private place for further search after gettong diagnosed, but where o what kind of doctor should i contact?\u00a0",

I was a fitness fanatic too, went to the gym 5 times a week loved it, I haven't been able to go for 3 months, really frustrating, I really want to hear from someone with hope please.\r\nI am HLAB27 positive and my protein levels are around 150 but have been as high as 190.",

Was treated with painkillers, anti-inflammatories, sulphasalazine, steriod injections. \r\nThe worst of the pain went within about 4 months, but I was actually unwell for about a year in total (remaining aches, severe fatigue) and had to have time out of university.\r\nI made a good recovery, although I was left with joint damage/some restricted movement in my right hand. I felt actually quite lucky this was the only damage, as people with a permanent arthritis have to deal with so much more ongoing pain/damage.\r\nI found cod liver oil taken daily to be really helpful, as well as sticking to a very good diet (no processed foods) and lots of sleep.\r\n\r\nI have for the most part been well since then, but I have had other (not as severe) flare-ups of reactive arthritis (cause unknown) from time to time. I am currently suffering with some knee, wrist and jaw pain. Although it is uncomfortable, I have not had anything that has restricted my everyday life too much and I do not take permanent medication, just when I need it.\r\nAll my research has shown people with reactive arthritis in most cases do get better within a few months from flare-ups, so try to stay patient and keep positive..... x",

                    "post": "Hi\r\n\r\nOn 1st Jan this year my left ankle was aching. Hobbled about for a few days then off to A&E unable to walk (bank holidays so doc not open).  I was advised torn ligument and sent away with crutches.  I complained about ache in other ankle and this was put down to putting extra strain due to left ankle.\r\n\r\nThe following weekend, both ankles like elephant feet, wrist very painful and swollen finger.  Sent back to A&E to be told they think Reactive Arthritis.  Given co-codamol and anti anti inflammatory also scans taken of ankles.  By this time I have never looked so bad, in agony, took an hour to get off house, crying my eyes out in the hospital (was in pain and they were just looking at me!) hadn't left sofa in a week and had to use a bucket for a pee! Worst experience ever. \r\n\r\nAfter three weeks sent to Rheumatology Dept at hospital.  My GP feared it was the start of rheumatoid arthritis.  At this stage I am at wits end - before 1st Jan I was at the gym six days out of seven and I'm 31. Went from really fit to criple. \r\n\r\nWaited one month on appointment.  By this time I am determined that thing was not going to take my youth(ish).  I went back to my personal trainer and focussed on low impact exercises.\r\n\r\nAt hospital had more scans (bones and chest), bloods and urine.  Up to high 90!\r\n\r\nAll results came back clear, the source will always remain a mystery. They reckon I got food poisoing or a virus Nov/Dec (un-noticed by myself).  I hadnt been ill since 2003 but weird I had fever the week before the arthritis hit so I am in two minds as to whether it actually does take a couple of months to surface.   \r\n\r\nSo here I am, 87 days later.  I am back to Body Attack twice a week, LBT twice a week, cycling 50 miles every week and spin/gym in between.  I ache still a little in ankle and wrist.  They said 3 months full recovery so I am hopeful this will pass but a little sneeky feeling that it may be with me for good now but not the end of the world. \r\n\r\nYes there is light at the end of the tunnel.  As soon as you can get back on your feet try your best to get back to fitness.  When I first went back to exercise class I had a corner to myself, I was all over the place - folk couldn't believe their eyes but practice makes perfect.  \r\n\r\nI am scared this will return - I take vit c every day and try and have a good staple diet - porridge for my breakfast and mum's lentil soup for tea plus lots of fruit.   \r\n\r\nI hope my post has helped, I read 1000s of these to try and understand what was wrong with me - focus on getting healthy and stay stong x",

There are three brigs they have to try before going on to more expensive ones - sulphalazine, \r\nMethotrexate and Hydroxichloroquine\r\nI contracted this awful disease four and a half years ago after a virus infection. My ankle became the size of an elephants and was agony. The doctors had no idea what it was, I was sent for an xray and given pain killers. Over the next few weeks the swelling travelled up to both knees which were unrecognisable and then to my hips. I went to the doctors  on many occasions but was just given pain killers until at long last six months later I was referred to the Rheumatologist. Two minutes after walking in he told me I had RA and that he \r\ncould help. I was given a steroid injection, pain killers and sulphalazine. At this time I was screaming in agony, unable to walk or climb the stairs. The sulphalazine made me feel very I'll so had to stop it and went on to hydroxychloriquine instead. I also suffered the red rash on my feet which is a known symptom. I was on steroids for years eventually weaning myself off them as I was worried about my bones.\r\nFour years later I am not cured but manage it. My knees are ok as is my ankle and the damage is minimal. \r\nUnfortunately the same can't be said of my hips. I am now awaiting total hip replacement of both hips as \r\nthey are totally damaged. I have had an injection straight into the worst one to tide me over until the first op which has really helped and I still take numerous pain killers and the rheumatologist wants me to take loads more tablets and use a pain patch. The Orthopaedic surgeon says no to bother as they only thing that will \r\nwork is replacement and to do it now when I am young enough to get the full benefit from it.\r\nIt is a nasty disease but can be managed but you need to find the right Doctors and Specialists to help.",

At the beginning it only affected my knees , thumb and wrist , I was doing alright for a while after being on sulfasalazine and methotrexate for quite a while , I also take tramadol , lodine and amatripteline. In august I had steriod injections in both knees and a about 24cc of fulid removed from one of them , the steriod injections in my joints seem to help me the most for the pain relief . \r\n\r\nI have just gotten used to being in pain so just try and get on with things the best i can I am 33yrs old and my youngest is only a toddler so it can be very hard trying to keep up with her .\r\n\r\nI dont think i have got it under control yet , there was a good few months when it was ok not to much stiffness or pain . Just about 7wks ago i started getting a stiff neck swelling in my feet and ankles so I metioned it to my consultant at my appointment on the 9th of this month, sent for xrays and upped my methotrexate and changed the anti inflamatory i take and iv to go back in 4 wks .\r\n\r\nSince i was there I can honestly say I dont think I have ever been in so much pain , the pain in my neck has travelled down the right side onto my shoulder , my thumb has never been so swollen ,  cant wear most of  my shoes because my feet are so swollen my toes dont even bend . My husband says that Im walking like a penguin lol , He trys to make me laugh because right now i feel like crying  most days , I get frustrated trying to do the simplest things . Everything takes so much longer sometimes i cant leave the house for days I am in that much pain .\r\n\r\nWhen i was first diagnosed I was told because I also have the hbla27 gene that it can take a while to get this under control , but i didnt think after 4yrs i would still me in so much pain .\r\n\r\nThrough reading other peoples storys i know there is light at the end of the tunnel its just taking longer for me , so hopefully my next visit to the consultant will be a good one and I can finally get the disease under control .",

                    "post": "Hi,\n\nI know you posted your message a few years ago and I sincerely hope you have recovered by now. In the unfortunate even that you have not, then may I point you in the direction of the following book by Barbara Allan: Conquering Arthritis. Available on Amazon - have a look at reviews of customers who have also suffered and are now cured after discovering the cause. If you check amazon you will see more reviews there. She is a former sufferer of reactive arthritis (Reiters Syndrome) and suffered for years (11yrs if I remember correctly) and found out that all reactive arthritis is caused by a food allergy that you can be tested for. She went on a green juice fast for about a week and was pain free 3 days into the fast. She then discovered that the illness is diet related.\n\nBasically, a combination of things can cause your intestinal tract (gut) to become leaky (known as leaky gut syndrome) and when there are tiny holes formed in the gut then some larger food particles can escape into the blood stream. When this happens, your immune system recognises that something foreign is in the blood  and issues an immune response to attack the foreign substance. Pieces of food should not be in the blood, they should go through the gut process (something like - stomach - duedenum - liver etc and then get asssimilated into the blood once it has all been broken down to provide nutrients to the blood).\n\nThere are also other causes that can cause reactive arthritis (bacteria from root canal treated  teeth - in this case remove them, overly clogged liver with liver stones - in this case do a liver flush as described by Andreas Moritz in his book the amazng liver and gallbladder flush, mercury poisoning from fillings - in this event remove them from a hollistic dentist and use bentonite clay baths and internally - food grade - to detox heavy metals) but these are not as common. If you don't heal on the strict juice fast then you will need to look deeper and the 3 suggestions above should have you covered. \n\nI hope this information is of benefit to you and all the best to those that are suffering from this aweful illness.\n\nIn health always,\n\nAzim.",

I know some of you will think I'm over-simplifying things, but I had a similar problem at age 21. I went to see the most brilliant man who tested me for food allergies and put me on a strict diet. Within a year I was totally pain free. Since then I have run three half marathons, spent 13 years in the T.A., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis man was Gwynne H. Davies. Google him, buy his books, but more importantly, get an appointment with one of the people he trained because he's now retired.\r\n\r\nDon't think of this as some sort of quack remedy. Please realise that the doctors have NEVER cured anyone with arthritis. They just give more and more powerful painkillers.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I suggest is stop taking ALL dairy products. Just totally cut it out. There are alternatives if you must have milk (almond milk). Be VERY strict about this because there is milk in so many food stuffs. Also, eat lots of fresh fruit and veg, and NEVER eat anything out of a tin. Try it. What have you got to lose?\r\n\r\nI am not some insane person who owns 75 cats and wears flowers in my hair. I am an engineer and mathematician and I don't believe in most alternative therapies. This isn't one, it's just plain sense. We are what we eat.\r\n\r\nAnd get an appointment with one of Gwynnes people.\r\n\r\nGood luck. And as Gwynne says in his books: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH ARTHRITIS.\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\n\r\nIan.",

I do have joint pain and am due to have some replacements but I can do most things although I will suffer the next day and do not have the stamina I had before. I hardly take any drugs any more just prescription co codamol and only twice a day. Compared to the early days with swollen joints and agony today things are good. Like someone else said I do walk badly   (like a penguin) and use a stick for distance or on a bad day but things are good. Take heart, it takes time but you will get there, work out what drugs suit you and move as much as you can and stay positive. Things will \r\nimprove.",

It started in my big toe, progressing to foot, knee, and hands and has made me very tired to the extent that I have had to take frequent rests.\r\nI have been taking ibuprofen every six hours and omega 3 and some other supplements which I needed. I lost weight drematically, and was told that I looked awful. After 3 months, I can walk up and down stairs more or less normally, go on a 5 mile walk. It is improving daily and I have given up taking the painkillers. I am 67, which is quite old for this complaint,(I am told).\r\nIt will get better, so don't lose hope. You will suddenly find yourself doing something which was previously difficult to do, without thinking about it, and realize that you are getting better and the pain is subsiding. My wife was driven mad with the idea of living with an invalid, which didn't help much, but I am recovering and life is getting back to normal. I shall be skiing in January as usual, I am sure.

                    "post": "<p>Info</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported nearly half a million cases of healthcare-associated infection with C. difficile in 2011. Those affected tend to be older patients who frequently or recently received antibiotics and healthcare in the hospital setting. Interdiction of this epidemic has involved changing prescribing practices and hygienic and disinfectant guidelines in hospitals. The importance of this infection to hospitals has increased drastically with its incidence. Reactive arthritis is more often an outpatient concern and a cause of morbidity rather than mortality, but recognition of its associated etiologies, including occult ones such as Clostridium, can help a clinician more holistically appreciate a clinical presentation.</p><p></p><p>Reactive arthritis is commonly referred to by its eponym Reiter&#39;s syndrome for Dr. Hans Reiter, who described a triad of non-gonococcal urethritis, arthritis, and uveitis in a German officer during World War One. It is an inflammatory arthritis which is reactive to some other infection. Classically, this infection is genitourinary Chlamydia, but in the intervening century a wider range of infections producing this syndrome have been accepted. Reactive arthritis most often involves joints asymmetrically. While infection plays a role in its etiology, it is distinguished from septic arthritis by lack of organisms in the involved joint and characteristic inflammatory rather than infectious findings on synovial fluid analysis.</p><p></p><p>Many mild cases of reactive arthritis are certainly unrecognized and may not present to medical attention (1). In this case, the duration of time between diarrhea, or at least when it was first recognized and treated, and arthritis symptoms was 23 days. The interval between diarrhea and onset of arthritis is variable (2). Had the patient not been under medical surveillance as inpatient for recurrent abdominal pain, the stiff knee may have been left to resolve on its own. If the preceding infection was unknown, the association between it and the joint involvement may not have been drawn. If the effusion developed in the outpatient setting, it may initially be attributed to trauma. Confidence in the diagnosis of this case is enhanced by knowledge of the recent medical history and active surveillance in the inpatient setting when reactive arthritis developed.</p>",

Try to be as happy as possible and live your life as you should, people with RA are much much worse, our disease reaches the maximum at some point and stops developing to the dangerous level. Find the NsAIDs that works for you the best and don&#39;t worry about these Flares Ups that we get.. I mostly get them when I get upset but after a day or 2 they go away and then come back after some days in an unending cycle, each body and each immune system acts differently and can be control differently. It seems our bodies are special and do not like bacteria at all, that makes them react to them with harmful effects. Mind is overall -&gt; Our mood is our life - Putting your mind in anxiety and stress and be ready for the next flare up which eventually will stop when your mood changes, that&#39;s me, a reactive arthritis sufferer for the last year, I stop inflammation when I want by changing my mood and stop thinking about it because when you think about this and how much it changed your life blah blah blah all that inside 1 mind doctors will start connecting Autoimmune arthritis of any kind with high iQ..  So feel clever, proud and special for having an autoimmune disease and thank your body for doing everything it can to protect you even in a wrong way..  It&#39;s like cutting your self with a knife and you wife brings you a bottle of whisky instead of paper thank her before she throws it in your head..  That&#39;s what I call pain not some silly fluid in the joints. Don&#39;t have hope..  You don&#39;t need it, let the children with cancer have for you be thankful and have a great life with lots of love and don&#39;t worry about flare ups, no need for doctors to tell you what to do..  you won&#39;t die anytime soon if that what worries you.. No matter what there are always warnings about these little percentage of organ inflammation, you will feel other type of pain if you do. remember your immune system is your friend not your enemy, it would never cause you a fatal problem only put you into trouble for a few months years decades, don&#39;t worry about when it will stop, It&#39;s a course set by your immune system and the road might be small big huge? We can never know this but we are in 2017 now and not in 1917, imagine how nice it would be without our nice cyclosporin and methotrexate etc. And with wars causing you fear=flares up and had to work like a slave for a bit of bread..  We live in the age of drugs and the age that will soon bring DNA engineering in action, there absolutely nothing to worry about whatever immune system response you have..  So to sum up </p><p>-ReA is: Easily controlled</p><p>               non-fatal </p><p>               Requires you to be happy </p><p>               Makes you lose weight </p><p>               </p><p></p><p>i think my life got better, I learned how to express my self though this..  I cut smoke I exercise I eat better I feel happier in the end, I might not be able to run and jump at some days and these days means we get some rest and relax..  It&#39;s like putting unorganised people in a program and making your life from boring and usual to something greater.. Be positive, stay positive..  Love life and keep in mind all the lessons you learned from this disease as it&#39;s a great teacher about the importance of having a healthy life!!!!  Have a good day reader and be always happy <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/smile.gif\" alt=\"smile\" /> </p>",

I developed sore knees that I thought I injured from doing yoga. About 1-2 weeks later my right shoulder was extremely sore. In 3 weeks my knees were so swollen my jeans wouldn&#39;t fit and I needed crutches to make it to the bathroom. Arthritis was migratory and severe. It went to my hands and I couldn&#39;t touch my thumb to finger 4&amp;5 without pain. I played keyboards and guitar previously. It went to my wrists and I needed both hands to turn the key in the ignition. When in my shoulders I couldn&#39;t even shave without holding my elbow to move the razor. This was now 9 months in with no diagnosis. Later that day I developed food poisoning and about 4 hours later I could flap my arms like a chicken with no pain. That led doctors to believe it was ra. </p><p>Through self research I found diet could help the symptoms so I only ate fruit and vegetables. I lost 51 pounds in 62 days. 213 lbs to 162 lbs. I received corticosteroid in my knees and had them drained. The arthritis would be gone for about a week and then return. Once they decided it was ra I was given pregnezone(?) and that gave me relief for about a month. I was also prescribed methotrexate and folic acid. It is now 10 months later and 6 weeks after the pregnezone and arthritis is returning. I&#39;m also getting stiffness in the spine from my neck to my hips. Making it hard to take deep breaths. I have so many questions now and hope someone can shed some light on with their experience. </p><p>I don&#39;t recall getting an infection or being sick before this happened. </p><p>I was a vegetarian for approximately 1 year before this developed. </p><p>I&#39;m no longer a vegetarian as my naturopath though lack of protein may have been part of my problem. </p><p>I can control the pain somewhat through diet but can&#39;t gain any weight of course. </p><p>I don&#39;t think I have HBLA-27 (?) they did test for it but I can&#39;t remember. I will find out again. I had to quit my job as a cable installer and am now in sales. </p><p>None of my doctors have addressed how I got it although tests have been done. Doc says I can&#39;t have the typical causes or I would have diarrhea. Yet 7 months after getting it I throw up and I&#39;m arthritis free?!?! </p><p>Has anyone experienced anything like this? </p><p>Thank you</p><p>Troy </p>",

Some believe that the inflammation is coming from the gut as an unhealthy gut becomes leaky and inflammation occurs throughout the body.\r\n\r\nLook into florostor. I started taking it after this most recent flare and i swear it is helping to calm things down. Otherwise, fish oil, tumeric and vitamin C.

The myopic nature of Western medicine (and doctors) can be frustrating when dealing with symptoms that are very real to us but not so to those treating us. However, I&#39;ve found that the key is to educate oneself, reach out to others in the same boat and try to find healthcare specialists who are willing to think outside of the box.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ve been dealing with ReA since it was first diagnosed after a chlamydia infection in 1991. Joint pain in the hips, knees and feet are the most severe manifestation of the disease in my case, with minor urethritis. My flares are almost always the same in severity and duration, never lasting more than two weeks. Fortunately, I&#39;ve had very long periods of remission during which symptoms were minor and did not affect my life in a big way. I am HLA B27 negative.</p><p></p><p>Since 2011, I have seen a ramp-up in the number of flares. Coincidentally, that is the year that my doctor put me on a statin to control borderline cholesterol. A few of the flare-ups have been triggered by food poisoning or bad colds, but the majority occurred after unprotected oral sex. All my STD tests came back negative. My doctor prescribed antibiotics to treat what he thought was prostatatis, though I was dubious.</p><p></p><p>I believe that something has caused my immune system to go into overdrive, causing it to overreact to what should be considered normal bacteria (in a woman&#39;s mouth) during oral sex and triggering the the ReA flare. Has anybody else had this experience? Does it make sense? I&#39;m also wondering if the statin I&#39;ve been taking since 2011 has played any role in making me more susceptible to flares.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m considering dumping the statins on a trial basis to see if it makes a difference, though my doctor will think I&#39;m crazy.</p>",

            "post": "<p>Hi Everyone. I signed up to this after spending countless hours searching the web for Reactive Arthritis support/help/cures....you name it. I&#39;m a 26 year old female, with a previously extremely healthy medical history. In 2015, I went solo travelling around SE Asia, 26 days into my trip I woke up one morning with a sore wrist. The day before I had been kayaking so figured I must have done something to it then. Unfortunately a day later, the pain was unbearable and my movement was restricted and it was also very swollen. The same feeling then occured in my right knee (it was in my left wrist) and I couldn&#39;t bed my leg at all. My knee swoll up so bad we all nicknamed it elephant leg, but I was in agony. I tried to push through but as the days went by, more joints were affected - my left elbow and shoulder, my right shoulder, my breastbone/sternum. Day 48 - I travelled back to UK, terrified and crippled with pain. There is no family history of arthritis and I was fighting fit prior to the trip - gym every morning before 7am etc. When I got home a GP was concerned it was rheumatoid however a rheumatologist dismissed that and guessed it was reactive due to the fact I&#39;d had a &#39;mild&#39; stomach bug a couple of weeks before my symptoms appeared when I was abroad. My Rheumatologist was confident that steroids and a steroid injection would help and that it would only be a temporary thing - 1 year and 4 months later I still have it. I only came off steroids in the last three months, when I came back home it then progressed into my SI joints (near your bum/lower back). I tried methotrexate but just hated taking it. Eventually, I was put onto these biologic medicines, which are in the injection form. For the last three months, I&#39;ve been injecting myself once a week with Embrel. It definitely had been working, the pain has gone and aside from fatigue and a very weak wrist, I felt much better. I was able to start going to more advanced pilates classes again and dealing with it quite well. The injections have unfortunately given me quite a few side effects. I am normally quite upbeat, but I&#39;ve felt very low and &#39;empty&#39;, my appetite has been up and down and my energy levels are definitely not the best they&#39;ve been. However in the last week or so, I&#39;ve had a numbing/dead leg sensation in my left leg...this can be a rare side effect and I&#39;m just gutted. I started working again full time in April, took on a new job in marketing which I love but it&#39;s so demanding....I refuse to get ill again. I&#39;ve not taken the injection in over two weeks and already feel the pain coming back. I&#39;ve had no support from my so called &#39;support line&#39; - the numbness of my leg was extremely concerning yet i&#39;ve had no response from the nurse or my Rheumatologist. It makes me despair. I do get very angry, I always took care of myself and can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m stuck with this. My diet was always very good but in the last year I&#39;ve changed to plant based only to see if that makes a difference but it&#39;s hard. I guess I just wanted to vent - sometimes I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s reactive arthritis, it seems so peculiar that it would come on when I&#39;m in a foreign country...but I don&#39;t know what it could be. If anyone has tried any other treatments, alternative therapies or just general thoughts I&#39;d love to hear. Thank you!</p>",

Your story is really similar to mine, I started with pain in one knee and pretty soon I was on crutches and it was in virtually all my joints. I too went to rheumatology (Rheumatoid A in family) but they diagnosed Reactive Arthritis, which I was happy about as it wasn&#39;t more serious and the prognosis is better. Approaching two years later I still have nasty flares and never really managed to put my finger on what it was that kick started this (no bug or infection) so similarly, not entirely convinced it is what it is. Also on a [b]plant based diet[/b] and used to look after myself, trained three times a week at karate, which I have had to give up. I think coming to terms that this isn&#39;t going away was really difficult for me, changing my lifestyle etc, so I really do empathise. Be kind to yourself, you deserve a little vent, reactive arthritis can be very debilitating but you&#39;re doing all the right things, your diet, gentle exercise. Hopefully the time between flares and thelength of flares will decrease and you can do more of what you can enjoy. All the best. </p>",

I&#39;m sorry that you also are suffering and almost a little &#39;in the dark&#39; in terms of not truly knowing what it is. Can I ask if you&#39;re on any long term medication? Or when you have flare ups, is that when you would take something for the pain? Since I got this, I&#39;ve been on medication constantly e.g. sterioids first, metheotrexate, now the Embrel injection. I&#39;ve been reading some previous forums where a lot of sufferers seem to be pain and medicine free unless they have a flare up. I would settle for bad flare ups if it meant just taking medication during those worse episodes, my goal is just to be off any form of medication but I&#39;m not sure if I will ever get to that stage.&#160;</p>"

I can manage to work and still do my daily activities normally, though I noticed my knee pain is getting progressively worse. I do have a family history of arthritis as my mother has Rheumatoid Arthritis. She's managed to enter remission and it's helping me become more hopeful. I am a 20yr old male who use to be extremely active in body building and working. I just feel as if I will never be the same way again. There are so many \"what if's\" and the overthinking is starting to take a toll on my health as well. I'm finding hard to sleep, be happy, or even want to get out of bed. Thank heaven that I am still eating normally. Though I know a change of diet would help, I have no idea where to behind. Here's my story. I look forward to hearing from you all. Thank you.",

But at least we're in this together. \r\n\r\nI have seen a Rheumatologist and he was able to give me an injection of Depo-Medrol, it's been about 6 days now and I see nor feel no different at all. I completely understand the pain and the mental torture that comes with it. I don't see an end either. But my mother did tell me about dieting and how it plays a major role in healing and treating arthritis. I am going to look into diets as well as doing yoga and swimming, those are two greatly benefiting exercises that not only help physically but help with the depression too. If I find any good diets or exercises I'll be sure to share them with you.\r\n\r\nI read a story recently about a man who had reactive arthritis, he had a strict diet as well as exercised and took daily multivitamins and after some months he is now RA free for two years! That's given me hope! "

I was tested for chlamydiae & Gonorrhea (GC) before going on any medicine. Results, negative.\r\n\r\n4 weeks post exposure \u2013 started getting joint pain, prostatitis, mouth sore, burning eye, and ill feeling.\r\n\r\nWent to Infectious disease physician \u2013 he said this sounds like ReA. Reactive arthritis and it will go away. I wish he was right.\r\n\r\nDoc, decided to run testing for GC, Urine culture, HIV 1/2, EBV, CMV, RPR, CBC, ESR, CRP, CK, ANA, Rheumatoid Panel, and some infectious stuff.\r\n\r\nI was tested for Chlamydia & Gonorrhea of Urine using NAA DNA test. And C. trachomatis, C.pneumoniae or C. psittaci using IGG / IGM. Results: Negative. No post exposure ever detected. Nothing.\r\n\r\nResults \u2013 Negative.\r\n\r\nMy blood was spanking clean except high CK Total level. This is 8 weeks post exposure.\r\n\r\nDoc decided to give me Doxy 100mg for 30 days, Z-Pack for 30 days, and Cipro 30 days. I took all those throughout 5 month period.\r\n\r\nNOTHING HELP.\r\n\r\nJoint pain continue and eventually started causing Spine pain and stiffness along with neck pain.\r\n\r\nOne year exactly, I ask my doc about Flagyl. He prescribe and I took it. WOW, Flagyl instantly gave me pain relief and decrease in symptoms. My physician thought it must be anti-inflammatory effect.\r\n\r\nI said what the hell it helps so I keep taking it on and off. Ok so at this point i\u2019m able to control my pain.\r\n\r\nHowever, (present day 1 year and half) post exposure \u2013 I decided to see rheumatology who decided to do X-Ray and MRI of SI Joint. Results: Negative, no inflammation seen.\r\n\r\nrheumatology is confuse and says I should take prednisone -> Sulfasalsaine -> TNF Blocker.\r\n\r\nI kindly told doc, FLAGYL helps. rheumatology says impossible and no such thing.\r\n\r\nHere i am today, all my blood work is negative except high CK level (600). rheumatology is asking I get EMG test done next week to rule out muscle disease which he thinks has nothing to do with arthritis pain. Two different issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver last two years I\u2019ve seen 5 Urologist, Rheumatology, 1 ID doc. None of these guys are able to pin point or cause of triggering bacteria.\r\n\r\nUrologist has done prostate secretion for anaerobic and aerobic culture along with urine culture. Results: Negative. No growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlagyl is only antibiotics that helps with all my symptoms but they come right back if I stop FLAGYL even for a day. So I decided to take PREDNISONE to see if it helps.\r\n\r\nCould anyone here help me out? How did this immune process start? Is there an active infection? Is this disease like an on switch type?\r\n\r\nI am confuse and I am not sure which doctor to see because none of them are helpful.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t mind taking Flagyl for ever / Doxcy.\r\n\r\nMy ID doc is thinking of trying bacterim ds, he says ReA / AS can be cause by klebsilla bacteria.\r\n\r\nMY ESR AND CRP has always being normal and no bacteria was ever found in my urine.\r\n\r\nAs of writing, I still have symptoms of prostatitis, joint pain, eye pain, ankle, knee, hip, spine stiffness and extreme fatigue.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm currently taking Doxy and Flagyl along with Duexis just to see if AB makes difference. I plan on taking doxy for 3 months before moving on to Bactrim. Levo / cipro i'm allergic to.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\u00a0\r\n\r\nP.S. Prednisone - does not work it makes joint pain worse.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nB",

It hasn't, if anything any progress made is in quick decline. \u00a0\r\n\r\nIm not not sure how these things work, I was given my diagnosis and pointed to the door but I started with mouth ulcers, fatigue, sore knees and red swollen eyes before the joint and muscle pain went wide spread. \u00a0I just cracked on with things and next minute, the pain in my right knee was excruciating. \u00a0Went to the doctor and had x rays and all was fine. \u00a0Within a few days it was in my other knee and my elbows, fingers, wrists, you name it. \u00a0Serious fatigue followed and I was so spaced out I could barely finish a sentence. \u00a0Ended up on a walking stick and just normal stuff like cooking and personal care became almost impossible. Back at the doctors they said I had a virus but I insisted on a rheumatology app as it runs in my family and I had had ongoing problems with sore knees for years. The ReA symptoms came first - not sure if that's normal but things had improved significantly by the time my rheumatology app came and I got my diagnosis. \u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm almost a year on and so so tired, eyes are bright red and swollen, pain in many joints, just using anti inflammatories and pain relief. \u00a0Physio tells me I should be back to normal now, exercise doesn't seem to help and whilst I'm super grateful to have some movement back, I'm just wondering when this will end! I was clear for any infection aside from a slightly raised liver reading so no actual indication of what the virus was and why the arthritis started first, \u00a0bit of a mystery. \u00a0I'm not sure I have shed any light on your situation I am afraid but wanted to share mine so you know you are not alone and interested in the progress of the thread. \u00a0All the best x",

I spoke to my Rhemmy and hes not yet interested in jumping the shot gun about immuno suppresive drugs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, my Infectious disease doc says if I want to try bactrim hes okay with it. The problem with Bactrim is that I tried it before and within 5 days I started having horrible ear pain. So I'm not sure if i'm allergic to it or not.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm really thinking about trying Bactrim. Does Bactrim work again protozoal??\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe reason I say is this because Flagyl seems to work and help mellow out the arthritis pain, but far from a cure.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo what its doing is that its suppressing the immune system / the bug and delaying the response. However, if I go off Flagyl all my symptoms return. So the drug is doing something.\r\n\r\nMy doctors have no clue why Flagyl is working for arthritis as there are no studies indicating such response. And this is coming from 10 different physician I've seen. So you can see its hard to convince the doc that Flagyl is working.\r\n\r\nI got my ID doc to write me 6 refills so I'm okay but I don't think I want to take FLAGYL forever.\r\n\r\nIs immune suppresion drugs the only answer in truning this response off?\r\n\r\n\u00a0"

There is way too much to go into at the moment, but I will hit some of the highlights:\r\n\r\nI developed prostatitis about 13 years ago (the joint pain began in the summer of 2010). I never tested positive for anything, although I have been tested many times over the years. No drugs I took had any effect except Flagyl. The flagyl had definite effects for the prostatitis. However, I was taking Septra DS at the same time I took Flagyl. I am very curious to know the dosage of the flagyl you have taken and for how long.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I have also noticed that corticosteroids such as prednisone and injections clearly make the symptoms worse.\r\n\r\nI have been to see just about every type of doctor one could conceive of who might know something about this, and nothing really comes up positive. Most seem to think it is reactive arthritis, but can find no causative agent. Based on everything I know, I am convinced mine is a response to something I contracted from a female.\r\n\r\nOnce again, please let me know the dosages of flagyl and how long you took it. In the meantime, I will try to come up with a more extensive series of events, which I think may help you and others. By the way, it sounds as though you have tried the drugs that clear most of the common bacteria. Have you looked into ceftriaxone? The CDC recommends it as a first line of defense for gonorrhea. I know you tested negative for it, but I have a very strong suspicion that testing for these things is not nearly as fool proof as many believe. I am also wondering if you have ever been tested for trichomonas. I believe you said you are married. Have you and your partner had extensive testing? It's doubtful you would test positive for trich now, with all the flagyl you have taken, unless you and your significant other are reinfecting one another.\r\n\r\nTake care",

To manage pain, he takes Cataflam (50mg) 2X1 tablet a day.\r\n\r\nHe has bad and worse days, with severe pain in the morning gradually fading away as the painkiller kicks in. Then  there are a few pain-free hours in the day so he manages to go to work (he's a teacher), but the pain returns gradually starting like a clockwork at around 4pm (although it seems to  have returned earlier and earlier in the past few days). \r\n\r\nWe've been so hopeful that the meds would start working but there has been little or no improvement. His pain migrates around his body, from foot, to back,to chest, to jaw, to knee (a new pain), lower back, shoulders, often affecting more than one joint at a time. \r\n\r\nIn the past week he's also developed severe fatigue. He's been asleep before our little one-year-old son, who goes to bed at 8. He's been depressed too, partly because he's been putting on weight as he is not able to do exercise, and partly because he is losing hope for recovery and feeling down because he can't be the physically active daddy he'd like to be. Also, we're planning to try for another baby and while on Sulfasalazine, our chances are slim and there's also a risk of abnormalities. I know that many RA patients are on antidepressants, but we hope he can manage without them. \r\n\r\nI've read that Sulfasalazine doesn't take effect for the first 12weeks. Is there anyone out there for whom this medication has been effective? How long was the recovery phase? \r\n\r\nI know there's no way to predict how long my dear hubby will have to suffer this horrible disease, but reading success stories would help him keep the glimmer of hope that he will recover one day alive in him.",

                    "post": "Hello,\r\n\r\nUp until last week I have been on the same meds and dosage for 10 months, the docs also  said the same with me in that it would take 12 weeks for them to kick in!  My symptoms were not as bad as your husbands sound but did Sulfasalazine work??  Well I feel better after 10 months of taking them and I'm 95% back to normal.  I dont think my knee will ever be 100% again, even if I took Sulfs for the next 50 years but I can function normally which is the most important thing.  Because of this I decided to voluntarily stop taking Sulfs  last week.  Also I am sick of necking pills.  \r\n\r\nI think excercise is a major player in recovery.  Your husband might want to low impact sports like swimming or a excercise bike at home to keep any lower joints active and help build a sweat to lose weight  / fight depression (my mountain bike was a savour as it got me outdoors).  Overall I think it is worth taking them but do not just rely on them.  Keep reading about how other people have coped with ReA (i.e changing diet, ointments, acupunture etc)  and hopefully you will find your own method of dealing with it.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps in some way.\r\n\r\nBest Wishes\r\n\r\nG  ",

I am only 18 and it was the most agonising experiences iver ever had. \r\n\r\nMy pain was everywhere, hips were the most painful, to the point where i was bed bound for 2 months. I was on Sulfasalazine for two months before the doctors decided to take me off of them as i gained a lot of water weight and just wernt helping in anyway, instead they gave me a large steriod shot into my hips which after 2 weeks eased the pain tremodously. I was also on diclofenac and co-codemol to try and control the pain.\r\n\r\nThis was ongoing for about a year, i would get better for two months then one day i would wake up and coudldnt walk. A year on i still get good days and bad days, like today where my fingers swell, hips, knees and elbows are painful.\r\n\r\nI found that no medication really helped, just let the RA run its course. But i fount that going out even to town with my mum while she pushed me round in a wheelchair helped my spirits rather than laying in bed all day.\r\n\r\nHope this helped.",

                    "post": "Hi HopeforReA and others who have replied to my call. \r\n\r\nFirstly, I apologise for not having replied or updated our status for such a long time. The reason is that thankfully, my dear hubbie (DH) has recovered in the meantime and we were able to move on with our lives. Only now that I have been notified of HopeforReA\u2019s comment have I been reminded that I must share our experience and give hope for other sufferers. \r\n\r\nBasically, DH went from bad to worse with his symptoms, his pain migrating around his body from one joint to another (ankle/foot, knee, chest, shoulder, jaw, back). He was on Sulphasalazine and was seen by a doctor every few weeks for blood tests, but the pain did not lessen. He was taking 2 Cataflam (50mg) tablets a day for his pains, but there were days, he would have wanted to take more, were it not for his fear of becoming addicted/immune to the drug. It got to a point that the visits to the doctor became routine, she\u2019d collect the fee, prescribe the expensive drug, say that she sees some improvement in the foot (true, but how about all the other pains), but nothing changed. DH became more and more worried about the possible side effects of the medication, and got to a point in April (he fell ill in December) that he decided to stop seeing the doctor and stop taking Sulphasalazine, and take only the painkillers as they were the only things that had made a difference. Also, we were trying for a new baby, and the drug causes temporary infertility. Instead, he wanted to treat his condition with natural products. He started to eat blueberries, and other anti inflammatory fruit, drank acai juice and green tea, ate walnuts and other types of nuts and 75%+ cocoa chocolate. In addition, he started to take a variety of vitamins, which he still takes today: 2x1000mg Omega 3  pills(300mg active EPA/DHA), one Vitamin E (E-400i.u. d-Alpha.Form) pill, one Multivitamin (with minerals) tablet, one slow release 1000mg Vitamin C tablet and one 100mg iron tablet daily. In addition, he is taking 4 magnesium (250mg) and 3 zinc (15mg with copper) tablets a week. We created this vitamin menu for him based on research we did online. \r\n\r\nThe summer was difficult, and towards the end DH developed strange stomach aches and had diarrhoea daily, early (3-4am) in the morning. The stomach ache went later in the day after eating his breakfast. However, the ReA pains started to subside, and he went from having to take only one painkiller, and then he had the first few ReA free days I think around September, which was like a miracle. He had also started to do gentle swimming every day, 20 minutes only, but he felt much better for it. At the same time, he started to see a gastroenterologist and had numerous tests, CT, biopsy, and could find nothing that would cause his stomach pain. In the end a test for H-Pylori came back positive and DH was treated for it with some antibiotics (sorry don\u2019t know the type from the top of my head). However, the stomach pains came back after a while, and so he decided to stop drinking cow\u2019s milk and even now he drinks soya milk only. \r\n\r\nHe has been ReA free for almost a year now and we are living a perfectly normal life, with our new baby daughter, who is 7 months old now, and our lively 2 and a half year old toddler. DH has become really fit and is now running 10 Km every day on the treadmill. He still has a weak stomach every now and then.\r\n\r\nI hope and pray that we do not ever have to face this horrible debilitating disease again. I also hope that perhaps with our story, some of the ReA sufferers out there will get a glimmer of hope that their condition too will improve one day. \r\n",

Went on walking holidays, cycling and worked full time.  3 months ago I suddenly felt very unwell with swollen fingers,  generalised joint and muscle pains and hot/cold sweats.  Have had all tests for rheumatoid, lupus, lymes disease etc.  The only abnormality was raised ESR and CRP.  I was in so much pain which did not respond to naproxen that the GP gave me steroids and 3 months later am still slowly reducing.  I did come off after about a month and ended up in AE with palpitations, feeling faint and generally very unwell.  Consequently was put back on 40mg prednisolone and have now reduced slowly to 3mg. The GP diagnosed reactive arthritis but the rheumatologist did not think that would have made me feel so systemically unwell.  Was feeling much better last week, only had vague aches and pains and duly reduced steroid by 1mg as advised and now aching, very very fatigued, experiencing sweats again.  Not sure if this is a side effect of the steroids, has anyone else experienced these sweats, worse on exertion but come on day and night.  Feels more than normal menopausal flushes. Fingers still puffy but am able to wear rings again.  Feel as if am roller coaster at the moment, have few good days, feel almost normal then suddenly feel like someone has pulled the plug again!  Will it ever end?",

It took me a while to stop being proud and to accept their help. Since being prescribed with antibiotics and steroids I am starting to feel better not as painful. \r\nHowever I am getting sore throats often 4 in the last 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nLast night was the first time I managed to stay in bed instead of getting up and watching the TV until the\r\nearly hours and then having to have a nap to get rid of nausea, even though I woke up every hour.\r\nI believe that I am blessed as having read other peoples stories I am not so severe. \r\n\r\nI am feeling more positive and feel that I can face/alter they way manage if it should be short lived.\r\n\r\nFat Fingers have you seen a consultant or have you just stuck with your GP? \r\n\r\nBefore I got this infection I have suffered depression for a couple of years as mine is due to work stress\r\nI managed to get to see the mental health team and they said that they couldn't help me and the easiest\r\nsolution was to get a new job. Well good advise but Rome Wasn't Built in a Day.\r\n\r\nAnyway they did suggest a group called Mind and then have people who do sort of clubs to get you out \r\nand to join in activities and courses to help you. I was told I am a high maintenance person this is good\r\nas what they were saying that because I am seeking self help groups, being a mum, wife and working\r\nI am being proactive with my depression. Don't get me wrong, I have had hard times when I didn't want\r\nto carry on due to work and wanted out of that situation so I took drastic measures, so I thought.\r\nBut it turned out I didn't get the reaction that I craved as I felt more for my children. It has been so hard,\r\nbut by trying to stay positive it helps.  One of the things that mind helped me with is a first aid box for \r\nmy depression. You put things in a box that you like doing and memories photos and think of the good \r\ntimes. I have lots of face masks the peel off kind and memories of walking at the beach.\r\n\r\nI hope I have given you some positive help. Please stay in touch.  Merry Christmas, please stay well  \r\nand bless you. :)",

I have found that as I reduced the steroids (am only on 2mg daily now) I have more stamina.  That could explain your fatigue, plus the fact that you have been so poorly.

Even my skin felt odd, my face was puffy and waxy with swelling around eyes.  I was grateful for the steroids initially to help with the pain but if you read the side effects and withdrawal effects they are awful.  I found that when I started reducing I would have a flare and feel worse for a few days.  the temptation was to increase again but the symptoms of a flare are the same as withdrawal.  For that reason have persevered and am now down to 2mg. Have to go for blood tests on the 2nd but the way I feel now am hopeful the ESR and CRP will be normal. Will try to be off steroids before I go to see rheumatologist on the 30th.

I rested for the rest of the day as I knew I had to walk back from our evening out. The evening was fun, \r\n\r\nThe walk back was not so fun long and tiring. Spent most of the day in bed today recovering with aches and pains in my muscles (Calves).\r\n\r\nI looked up cyst under the skin but didn't come up with much so will investigate.\r\n\r\nI think your right it will be a case of good day - bad day until the bad day ceases. I will keep you posted.\r\n\r\nxxx ",

I found that on a good day I tried to do things as normal and then paid for it the day after. It is very disappointing but hopefully, like me, you will soon start to have. More good than bad days.  Today I  have been on a 4 mile walk, could not have done that 2 weeks ago but have got pain in my lower back and buttocks now but am feeling positive.  Thought I would never get back to work but am hopeful.  You will get muscle aches because they are out of condition but will come good in the end. Don't despair.  Hope we both have a healthier new year and I won't be calling myself fat fingers for much longer ! Lol xxxx",

                    "post": "Hello to all my fellow Reactive Arthritis sufferers.  I checked this forum back when I was first diagnosed to hear success stories so I owe it to others like me to follow up and share my own success story.  I started having problems 7 months ago.  At first it was severe lower back/hip pain (later we realized that it was probably the sacroiliac joint, but at the time it was hard to pinpoint) and was so bad that I couldn't walk without crutches and couldn't put any weight on my left side.  This was followed a few days later by severe swelling of my knee.  After that followed a long series of tests to figure out what was going on.  Eventually after a positive HLA-B27 test and after ruling out other possibilities my doctor was able to say that I have Reactive Arthritis.  Thankfully, I seem to have had a much easier time than others.  After a course of prednisone in about two weeks the sacroiliac pain was much better.  The knee swelling was much more of a problem.  I have had pain in the knee that is only really going away now (although I still have some pain at night).  I had back pains, pains along my spine in two spots, and tendon problems in my foot that made it very painful to walk.  Praise God, all of these pains have gone away after 7 months. I am still taking a quarter of a 15mg meloxicam pill every day, but am hoping to be off that soon.  \r\n\r\nI know that it is very discouraging when these pains don't seem to go away, but for me at least, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel.  Don't give up hope and just be patient.  Take joy in the small victories.  \r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nYankeeInRussia",

Initially, I had conjunctivitis and non-specific urethritis. I saw my GP about the former and went to the sexual health clinic about the latter, receiving successful treatments for both.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after this I started having strong pain and stiffness in my lower back, to the point where some days it was a struggle to even get up out of bed. I started taking high strength Ibuprofen, but it had little to no effect. This symptoms then extended to my hands and feet. I saw my GP, who did some blood work and detected high inflammation, saying that we could possibly be looking at Rheumatoid Arthritis. He then put me on Diclofenac. This helped more than the Ibuprofen but the pain and inflammation was still very much there and it is also very harsh on the stomach.</p><p></p><p>This was pretty much the situation for the best part of a year. I was signed off work and university for a year and didn&#39;t do a great deal besides sitting around being miserable. Daytime TV will do that to anybody! Anyway, I called the doctor&#39;s surgery, concerned about being on Diclofenac for such a prolonged period. I made an appointment at the same surgery but with a different GP. This time I mentioned everything. The joint pain, inflammation, conjunctivitis and NSU. I think this was probably out of sheer desperation at this point, just trying to find any cause or link. He said there&#39;s a very strong possibility that they are related and referred me to see a Rheumatologist at the hospital.</p><p></p><p>I had some more blood work done at the hospital and then came the appointment. The Rheumatologist diagnosed me with Reactive Arthritis/Rieter&#39;s Disease right there and then. He proceeded to give me a cortisone shot in the back side, which was far from pleasant! Thankfully though, this was all that was needed.</p><p></p><p>I am now 30 years old and have largely been syptom free since then, living a normal day to day life. I find that the only time I notice anything is if I let my body get run down. Thankfully these days I know what I&#39;m dealing with so I know how to manage it. I try to eat healthy, do plenty of exercise and get plenty of rest.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I appreciate that this course of action will not be appropriate for everybody but if I can help at least one person then I&#39;ll be very happy.

            "post": "Hi, I am new to this forum so thought I would give you some background before I ask questions.\r\n\r\nI am a 39 year old female in the UK. I first had a flare up 10 years ago which was suspected gout in my big toe which developed to pain in my whole leg and I was off work for around 6 weeks. Tried all painkillers going but to no avail.\r\n\r\nThen about 4 years later I started getting pain in my left hand and small joints, this then developed through my whole arm and again i was off work for around 6 weeks. In the meantime i was referred to rheumatology. They decided it was inflammatory arthritis but did not know the route cause and started me on hydroxycloriquine, 2 a day.\r\n\r\nLast year about 4 weeks after a bout of tonislitis (which I suffer from) I developed same symptoms in my right arm and again this progressed up my arm, I asked about other medication as I didnt feel the hydroxycloriquine was not working for me and was told not to stop taking it. I was given a steroid injection which did not work and eventually had a steroid infusion (1g of prednisilone), which releaved symptons almost immediately. My diagnosis was then changed to Reactive Arthritis.\r\n\r\nThe decision was taken to remove my tonsils to prevent further flare ups and in February this year I had them removed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in July\u00a0I developed a water infection and sure enough 4 weeks later\u00a0my right arm\u00a0started to get sore, as I was due to go abroad I asked for a steroid infusion to prevent further flare which was agreed but a much smaller dose than last time (250mg) which has had no effect. I was however given Sulphasalizine to start as well as hydroxycloriquine and I am on my 3rd week on it taking 2 tablets per day, slowly building to 4 a day. I have had no side effects so far apart from feeling a bit nauseus at times. I am now on my 4th week off work and can still see no light at the end of the tunnel with the pain.I have been in contact with the hospital and they are refusing to go with another steroid infusion (which I feel is the only thing that relieves pain) and I have been told i need to wait for the Sulphasalizne to take effect!!\r\n\r\nSo my questions:\r\n\r\nIf you have been on or are on Sulphasalizine, how long was it before you started to see results?\r\n\r\nalso, should I keep calling Rheumatology and insist they give me an infusion as a) I feel like i am constantly pestering them, even though last year they told me not to suffer in silence. and b) I cant sit by and just wait for the meds to kick in when Ive read it can be up to 12 weeks to see any effect?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I just want to return to a normal life with my husand and 14 year old son as when I am not on a flare I feel fine but whilst having a flare everything just goes on hold.",

In early December that cold turned into a really stubborn ear infection. I was in the hospital and on 3 different types of antibiotics. I got to go home after 8 days as long as I continued oral antibiotics for 3 more days. My stomach started acting strange(Urgency and mucus in stools) a week after I stopped the antibiotics. I was told to take an anti fungal and got some samples done. Everything came back normal. A few days later my ankle started having some mild pain and my stomach problems were slightly better. I woke up in the middle of the night thinking that I must have done something funny while chasing my daughter around the house. I woke up that morning needing to limp, but after walking for a little bit I felt better. Since my stomach was slightly better and I could leave the house I decided to take my daughter out for some fun and run some errands. That night was awful! It was seriously the most pain that I have ever felt and that's including the natural birth of a 9lb 3oz baby. I couldnt walk, I couldn't sit, ice hurt, pant legs hurt, everything hurt! I was shaking, sweating, gagging, I almost vomited a few times, and I passed out. I eventaully went to the emergency room and got xrays. I left with a diagnosis of a sprained ankle and was told to take tylenol and NOT ibuprofen because of my stomach. I couldn't sleep that night. Around 5am after crying all night my husband called our doctor and she told me to come in. She gave me a celebrex and told me to wait and see if it works. Then She gave me a intramuscular shot of tramadol and told me to wait. The pain was still there so she gave me tramadol pills. I fell asleep in the waiting room and finally could go home because the pain was slightly better. A few days later I had blood tests done. My Rhuematoid factor was 18, Creatine was 42, CRP was 101, PPC was <7. I continued the Celebrex, tramadol at night, and volteran cream. I started feeling a bit better and could stay still without pain. The I woke up one day with worse ankle pain, back pain, and elbow pain. I didn't leave the bed that day. I had more blood tests done 10 days after the first and my Creatine was 103, and my CRP was 39. I was sent to Dubai a week later because the doctors were worried that my kidneys were involved. The Rheumatologist in Dubai wanted to eliminated everything (particularly vasculitis, and Lupus) so I had a bunch of tests done. They found microscopic blood in my urine so they started me on steroids and scheduled more blood tests for the next morning. My Creatine went down to 55 and everything else was normal. The doctor said that maybe the large number was a fluke or maybe the steroids already started working after the first day. I left dubai with the diagnosis of Reactive Arthritis and a couple days later I found out I was HLA-B27 possitive. I was on prednisolone for 6 weeks starting at 30mg and tappering down to 5mg every other day. My ankle got better pretty quickly, but everytime I tappered I would have a slightly bad day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the steroids were done I started having minor pain more often and I was told it was normal to have some pain and to feel tired for a while afterwards. I could walk around all day, but I would feel pain and stiffness after sitting for awhile after the long walks. I often wake up with pain in my hands and get twinges of pain in other places like my knee, other ankle, and others. Somedays my stomach feels funny like it did at the beginning and I'm almost always exhausted! Even if I sleep 7-9 hours I feel really really lethargic, my muscles feel heavy, my eyes feel baggy, and I want to lay down after a few hours of being awake. It's kind of like the tired feeling you get before a cold. Some days I feel good, but most days I'm so tired. \u00a0Anyways yesterday I felt extra tired and then my big toe started hurting. I couldn't bend it as much and it hurt just sitting there (It was not like the first time though). Today my toe is a bit better, but it is still stiff. I am avoiding walking for a little bit so I don't aggrivated anything.\r\n\r\nOk so my questions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else still experience mild everyday pain 5 months after their initail flare? How long did it take for pain to go away?\u00a0\r\n\r\nDid anyone else have any warning signs before they got a flare?\u00a0\r\nLast time I was really tired and achy all over.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel the heavy lethargic feeling that I feel?\u00a0\r\n\r\nDid anyone have any stomach issues too?\u00a0\r\n\r\nHas anyone had a relapse and had a different joint become affected?\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnyone else get reactive arthritis from somthing other than STD or stomach infection? They think my trigger was the stubborn ear infection.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHas anyone healed and then became infected with the same disease again? Did it cause a flare again and if so was the flare worse the 2nd time?\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you!\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

However I have heard of others where it has reduced the frequency of RA flares.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess the effectiveness of this treatment depends on where the bacteria is and whether the bacteria in question is sensitive to the antibiotics prescribed.  It is important to check sensitivity of the bacteria otherwise you are taking antibiotics for no reason.  This is especially relevant if you are allergic to penecillin (a broad spectrum antibiotic) as other antibiotics have a smaller spectrum.\r\n\r\nHaving checked the above I would say it is worth a try.  Effectiveness is case dependent.\r\n\r\ngood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I was recently diagnosed with either Reactive Arthritis or Ankylosing Spondylitis following around 9 months of problems (stomach problems going back around six months before that too). One of the big issues I have is with my eyes. I have constant foreign body sensation and they are extremely bloodshot 24/7. As a result of this, my eye doctor has prescribed doxycycline to see if it will help the glands in my eyes produce more oils ( a few are clogged and it&#39;s an alternative use of tetracyclines). I&#39;ve been taking the antibiotics for just under two weeks, with a view to taking them for a minimum of three months or longer if they provide relief. Because I knew about antibiotic treatments for various forms of arthritis, including reactive and Lyme before starting, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye out for how my joints feel. It&#39;s early days, and i&#39;ll keep you posted. Currently, the joint pain has flared fairly significantly since I started, and the crepitus and joint cracking/grinding has been crazy. I&#39;m trying not to get disheartened as it&#39;s possible that it could be a herxheimer reaction of some sort. I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed that the doxycycline helps all of my symptoms. I shall let you know how I get on.</p>",

We have got limited options and it is a diversity for those who are not aware of abx.  Do not get disheartened please. As I read from other forums end websites it might take a long time for abx treatment to really work. You are right that abx can also be used for lyme etc. Doxy is also used for conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia.\r\nI can advise you to get blood tests regularly.  Check you liver enzymes coz the use of abx.   I do not know that you ve been using any other drugs like immunosuppressants or nsaids. If so it is a must.\r\nAlso another advise is to replace good bacteria that abx might kill with the use of acidophilus prebiotics. Although I am not certain that can be used together. Just have a look at it too.\r\nDo you know the triggering agent?     Salmonella , shigella? You said you had stomach problems. Did they make a stool culture? Do you have hlab27 gene too?\r\nI only use nsaids now . My hip is really bad and as a result I am on the verge of using tnf alpha.\r\nGood luck hope this doxy do the trick for you.\r\nKeep me informed about your situation.\r\n\r\n"

This inflammation can be a total headache. I still have mobility issues due to dislocation and labrel tear and excessive inflammation. I saw one of the best shoulder surgeons as a second opinion and he mentioned that I have torn my labarum all the way around and that I can\u2019t tear it anymore lol. Surgery was not a good option at the moment unless it starts dislocating or doesn\u2019t improve because looks like mobility and inflammation is my major problem. Looks like I have a case of frozen shoulder also which seems to be possibly reactive arthritis. I really don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t think the surgeon can really answer what the cause is but that some people can get these problems after dislocation and it can even take upto 18 months to settle even without reactive arthritis. So I guess this answers a lot of my questions. To be honest it has been pretty difficult and why I have come to these forums. Nobody understands at times and I just had no idea what to do. Inflammation can be relentless as we all know but seems like it needs a little help or time to settle it down. such as a cortisone injection which honestly helped significantly and possibly celebrex. I will have to get another if it gets worse again. He said I may end up getting surgery if I do not improve but there is no harm in waiting as it is torn all the way around. I just have a lot of hard work and physio to improve. I have to be careful not to provoke it. The labrem is like a piece of calamari that goes around your shoulder joint and connects to other things etc. Possibly why I am getting so much pain and stiffness at the moment. It generally tears after dislocation and may have torn it all the way like a month ago. I believe I am dealing with more than just a labral tear. This is when you deep down know its also ReA but nobody can answer you except the best of professionals ;) We cant even work out what the hell is happening to us and it must be even harder for the professionals to answer your questions. This surgeon that answered my questions today was awarded a medal for the highest marks across all surgical disciplines, he seemed to answer my questions better than anyone else."

Its in both knee joints and at one point the only way to get upstairs was pulling myself with the bannister as the pain was so bad especially in my right knee. My doctor just said it was a virus. I \u00a0have had some tenderness in bottom of feet, hip joints and shoulder joints and a bakers cyst at bottom of finger plus a sore throat. The knees eased after a couple of weeks (80% better) but last night it flared up again worse in left knee this time. Blood tests were normal and i am now waiting for knee x ray. It feels more like joint, muscle and cartlidge than bone. Any idea's please ?",

A number of variables can cause it and the issue is trying identify what...\r\n\r\nIf bacteria does cause your flare they can detect it in bloods; as antibodies to the bacteria will be present in higher concentrations.  However;  you have to do the blood test at the right time or it wont show up;  so it can take a while to get a concrete diagnosis.  Throat swabs can also help confirm.\r\n\r\nVery painful condition which is poorly understood.. record your patterns (i.e any symptoms the week prior to knee flare) as this can help with diagnosis.\r\n\r\nGood luck!.\r\n\r\nAdele",

I had a bit of a sore throat so they think it's from that. \r\nI've been feeling loads better - the knee pain arm and hands has gone - I had a steroid jag 6 weeks ago. I was just thinking I could get back to work as I'm desperate - as some of you will know, when you are at home your mind works over time, I'm at times feeling quite low and have gained 11lbs which in turn doesn't help. Anyway I walked a mile or so with my dog and did some gardening - nothing too major and now my back is in agony, I've got an ache down my arms - pain in my hips and my back too - is this to do with RA? The ache in my arms and hands is like one where you want to stretch to ease it away. I'm taking nurofen/paracetomol alternatively - I did have codeine but took a reaction to it.\r\nAny help, thoughts, experiences would be greatly appreciated :-)\r\nI'm a 36 year old female - not sure if any other info is needed!

Hopefully it will go away as only been 6 weeks and from what I have read most get better in a few months to a year to just disappear. It can be a very worrying time and don\u2019t quite understand what is happening. Try not to take too many paracetamol it won\u2019t be good for you over long period. You may need anti-inflammatory for pain. Anti-biotic if you have bacteria. Chlamydia or food poisoning bacteria like salmonella can cause it. You need to quickly treat underlying factors. In most cases of reactive arthritis. we seem to have a trigger which can trigger an auto immune response. They don\u2019t actually know how to cure or why it happens for certain but most get better with time and treatment. Some people respond better too different treatments. Going for walks is good but just build up overtime. Do about half the walk and see how you go. Try to keep as active as possible without overdoing it or straining muscles. Easy to say but alot of the time the pain just happens sometimes or just goes away sometimes. It is better to keep active with reactive arthritis. I have felt like I have turned too stone sometimes. Everything is so tight., Try to do light stretching or yoga. Dont overdo it. Good luck and hopefully you can get better very soon. \u00a0",

Do you have some days you feel loads better then and it just comes back?? Is your job a strenuous one?

            "post": "Hello everyone.  \r\n\r\nI'm  a 25 year old male from Canada. Before i got sick,  i was extremely athletic (5 days a week bodybuilding,  2 days a week playing professional soccer) . It all started from my trip to mexico.  When I came back I had upset stomach and alot og acid reflux for three or four days. Saw my GP,  was given Hpylori test and it came back negative.  After a few days i started feeling better. \r\nI'm sexualy quite active,  however very cautious and perform STD test every month.  Surprisingly I haven't gottrn anything so far, not even herpes type one or two.  I meet this girl on January 7th and kissed and made out (no sex)   and the next day she tells me she has herpes and has broken sore on her mouth.  I panicked that there is a chance for me to be infected,  then On January 10th i started having severe sorethroat along with high fever till January 15th. Since the symptoms werent accompanied by runny nose or other cold symptoms i saw my GP  to make sure i didn't have strep throat, mono or EBV or any other STDS.   I did a test,  amd all came back negative.  The next day as i was feeling better I went out with my friends and had couple of drinka.  I woke up on January 17th and i had a sharp pin in my right hand middle finger,  at first i thought maybe i was too drunk last night and have hit it somewhere. However.  i wake up the next day discovering my right hand point finger is  painful.  Specially when i tried to bend both at the sme time.  Few days pass,  middle finger pain subsides,  and only my point finger knuckle is a bit inflamed with tenderness.  I go on my soccer practice,  come home sleep and i get woken up with extreme pain in my shoulder joints,  and eye inflammation (felt like my eyes were popping out of my head).. The pain was so bad, i took a trip to ER and after witing for 14 hours to see a doctor (yes wonderful Canadian health system) i was only given advil and was sent home.  \r\n\r\nNext day i see my GP, he tells me this is more likely to be reactive arthritis,  we ran some blood test,  and everything came back normal,  crp level was at 1,  Rheumatoid factor was noy detectable, Anti ccp was negative. esr was normal.  I was prescribed Naproxen and sent home.  At this point shoulder pain and eye inflammation have subsided. However, i started feeling pain and tenderness on my left knee and left ankle.  (no swelling or redness).....after a few hours,  ive noticed the pains are migrating through my joints,  and when one subsides,  the other one gets affected.  For example,  when my knee and anckle pain subsided,  it started attacking my shoulder joint and shoulder blades.  Fast forward till January 28 i saw an internal specialist,  she took an xray,  ran blood virology, ran other immunology tests including hlab27 gene and all came back negative.  At this time my hands and knuckles are at no pain what so ever,  the only pain I have is in both knees,  heel part of my feet and my lower back.  I go out drinking again,  come home,  wake up with inflammed thumb knuckle with severe pain,  buttock hurts (as if i was sitting on a rock for days),  and the pain keeps migrating through my body.  Every single joint is being effected by now.  I really dont know whats wrong with me..... I look online,  and i dont see anyone with the same symptoms..... could it be reactive arthritis!? (i saw 5 gp and 1 internal medicine, they all agree its reactive arthritis).... however,  being a hypochondriac i feel like this might  also be rhumetoid arthritis..... tired of this pain... anyone with similar experience!? I havent been to the gym, or played soccer since,  im depreand have lost 15lbs. Any help is appreciated.  ",

Change you diet ASAP and go 'pure' for a few weeks - tons of veg, fruit, seeds, fish. Cut out the gluten and dairy and give your gut time to recover a bit \u00a0OR\u00a0\r\nit could be psoriasis - do you have this? If not then probably one of the first two at your age. \u00a0 I'd you have had x-rays of the joints and they are OK, and rheumatoid is OK, then ask for an ultrasound on your hands and check the issue is within the tendons. (This might also be the issue in heels with achiles too). \u00a0If within the tendon, then diet and physio and correct technique are the way forwards - the medics are not so much good then but the physios are...\u00a0\r\nin other words sounds like you have given up too early and are getting depressed. Find out whats wrong with you before you give up. Sounds lke they have got rid of the really nasty stuff so chances are its not so nasty but the bum thing really sounds like bursits and you seem to have inflammation at key tendon points to me... at your age chances are its technique and diet. \u00a0I;d get some condoms too as STD's trigger reactive arthritis and if you are Ok now, i wouldnt put myself in a position i might get it...\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo cheer up for goodness sakes; no reason to be depressed.. get a correct diagnosis and the above is a good place to start...\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

I was 31 years old when my joint pain started after passing blood with a potential samonella infection two years ago. The pain started in my shoulder blades,back and neck . The pain then travelled to my knees, hips heel and top of my hands (worst pain). I too wake in the morning with red puffy fingers from time to time. The fatigue was probably the hardest part to deal with. I seen 17 doctors over a period of two months with all symptoms red eyes etc and nobody put them all together. I paid privately to see a rhumy who diagnosed me within 5 mins. I had a mri of sacrolliac joint to rule out ankolysing spondlitis, which was negative. I have had xray of hands, feet ,neck and chest all negative. I am hlba27 negative and rf negative. I would say it took about 14months for pain to subside.  I had a slight relapse when i tore my medial ligament, the rhumy says trauma can set it off again. Today i am pain free and i see rhumy every 6 months. He says its a case of wait and see, if it develops to be chronic or not. \r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n",

                    "post": "Hi James! How are you getting on with all of this? I woke up in Mid November with a burning in my right elbow, which spread in the space of a week to all of my joints. I have had some days where things feel not too bad, the pain is still present, but mild, but other days where I can feel it all over the place again. I haven't had a diagnosis. Rheumatologist that I saw off handedly mentioned a reaction to an infection at some point. My blood tests are all clear also (I have a positive for Epstein Barr but not recent). I had some stomach issues that started around May last year that were diagnosed as right sided faecal loading. That diagnosis addressed the pain I was having in my gall bladder area, but I was having pain in the lowest part of my stomach also, so i'm wondering if that was my infection. It was pretty bad at the time, and came and went. It died away the last few months but I still feel it from time to time. I don't even know if that's solely down to me stopping trying to exercise and aggrevating it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, from the time when those stomach pains started, to my joint pain starting was a space of about 5 months (not that the stomach issues went away in that time.) The pain that i get feels like a migrating burning that moves around. It causes me more typical pain at times also, almost like I've sprained the joint, but most often, it feels like a burning within the joint. Like sunburn which varies in severity and is worst when i wake up or sit in one place for a long time. Right now it's worst in my knees, wrist and hands. Does this sound similar to what you have? I have no visible swelling at all. I also have red joints throughout my fingers, but I can't tell how different they were before because I wasn't paying much attention before they started burning.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reply because I thought i might have written your post when I first started reading it. My name is also James and was very physically active before this (trained no less than 5 nights a week and played soccer at least twice a week) I had decent muscle mass and trained for obstacle races. In the last 7 months however, that's all fallen off me. The clicking and grinding in my joints is one of the scariest parts for me, I even heard it in the centre of my chest the other night, as though someone was crushing a crisp packet in there. It wasn't my imagination because I could recreate it by moving my chest and breathing deeply. It feels as though all of my joints are deteriorating as there isn't a single one that isn't affected. Even my jaw is clicking and grinding when it never did it 6 months ago. Has anything been prescribed for you?",

                    "post": "Thank you Everyone for your comments. I'd like to share that I do Feel 90% better. I'd like to share the things I did that helped me with my recovery. As i was starting to feel better and sysmptoms were gone by 90% I came down with another flu which caused inflamation of the \u00a0heart sac (percarditis) which i thought i was having a heart attack, But things got better after i thought i was getting worst and there wasnt a light at the end of the tunnel. Things do get better. I implemented a regimen to my diet which I beleive it helped with my recovery.\u00a0\r\nPlease note I am not a doctor nor have any medical background. I'm simply sharing my own exprience. My father beleives that if a condition is developed within body itself, \u00a0it could also be reveresed by body itself. Therefore, he recommended I try some of his traditional herbal recipes which includes:\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. A glass of hot water with 1-1/2tbs turmeric, 1tb ginger, 1tb cinnamon. 3 times a day 30 minutes before each meal\u00a0\r\n2. boil 2 garlics in water, let it cool, and add apple juice to it. Have two tsb everyday upon waking up.\u00a0\r\n3. Red meat juice - this is done by putting a red meat in a jar, close the lid and place it in boiling water. Eventually after couple of hours, a juice gets settled in the jar. ( Some people get inflamation by having red meat, it was never the case for me, i found that the red meat juice helped me with my energy)\u00a0\r\n4. 150 billion probiotic pills ( this is the maximum I could find ath health stores.)\r\n5. branch chain amino acids( I used to take this to recover from working out, therefore, I started taking it as I thought might be beneficial for the joint pain)\u00a0\r\n6. High protien, low carb,low fat diet , followed by a high carb cyle diet.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlong with above regimen, I was also put on high doses of Ibuprufen for 5 days to help with the inflamation in my heart sac. (1200-1500 mgs/day) along with zantac to prevent ulcer.\u00a0\u00a0( but i do not think it contributed to my recovery as I was feeling better before I got the heart inflamation)\r\n\r\nlast but not least, get busy , go outside, hangout with friends, and try yourbest to force yourself to be like before. I know this is exteremly hard, but it does help with your energy level and overal health. I'm a hypochondriac, so this also added to my anxiety as I was googling for other causes and I noticed I was starting to have physical pain and symptoms that aren't usually there ( Mind is powerful). therefore, I stopped googling things and looking up diseases.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI was seen by an specialist, we ran test for lupus, Ra, and other Autoimmune diseases and it came back negative, doctors still are not sure what caused this reactive arthitis, I came back negative for EB virus , herpes and all other viruses. They think it might have been caused by a simple flu that I had prior to all of this .\r\n\r\nAs of now, I do have some inflamation in my joints sometimes, but they are not noticeable, unless I pay attention to them. (specially by my shoulder blades and ribs(costochondria). ) Other than that, I'm just happy im 90% better, and Hopefully i would not come down with another flu;)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you could always msg me. I hope you all do feel better.\u00a0\r\n\r\np.s Road to recovery was almost 2 month from the onset of the sympoms\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

            "post": "I have reactive arthritis (diagnosed) in about 15 joints beginning last year after a GI infection and it lasted in a severe state for about 4 months. I was bedridden for a good portion of that time and still have joint stiffness and pain, and until a recent severe flare up most of the heat in my joints was gone. It\u2019s not as bad as the first time, but following this trend of 2 flare ups per year and never having complete remission, I have dim prospects for my life and my longevity.\r\n\r\nI tried corticosteroids, Methotrexate and couldn\u2019t tolerate the SE. I refused a biologic for the risk of SE. I\u2019ve spent years on a clean diet and intense research to filter out of food allergies. Now I\u2019m looking for other options, as I cannot tolerate pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nOne treatment that was partially successful, and slacking off of it being one of the reasons for my recent relapse, is active (mostly methylated) B vitamin therapy. That being a personally adapted version of Freddd\u2019s protocol on the phoenixrising site, based on my own genetic profile and nutrahacker analysis. This was the only tolerable thing that made a difference during my first attack.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the methylation therapy, 2 options I see are extended fasting or juice fasting to reset the immune system & Hormone Replacement Therapy, such as Testosterone, which tends to strengthen the immune system and calm autoimmune attacks. Cortisol may also be an option, based on some reseach I've seen, but it's not without long term SE.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone else has tried these options, and if they could post their experience here to learn from.",

The biologics and methotrexate are to suppress the system not to strengthen the immune response.\u00a0\u00a0 It sounds like you may be in USA. Look up Seamus Mullen New York Chef and see what he did as his diet seemed to change his life round.\u00a0 I'd ask your rheumy before going ahead with anything that enhances your immune system - it is already in overdrive.\u00a0\u00a0 Hope this helps",

                    "post": "HI again, the other thing is that there are the results this week of a tests which aimed to reset the immune system in MS patients. Been in all the papers this week. What they did on 24 patients (one of whom died) was chemo to close down the immune system completely then stem cells to rebuid it - which it did and put the MS patients into remission and cured a load of them.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus to turn on and off the immune system is not that easy... it is the holy grail of medicine to a certain degree but you might be interested to look up the results in the papers this week.\r\n\u200bIve tried all sorts to try and give my immune system a shock to see if i can get it back to normal!!\u00a0 e.g. I had a yellow fever jab which is a live vaccine and i thought hey, maybe my body will go to work on that and it will realise what a real bug looks like and stop attacking me!\u00a0\u00a0 I would not recommend this to anyone...\r\n\u200bI didnt even get a sore arm for goodness sakes. I never get a cold. Nothing. Just stupid thing is attacking joints.\u00a0 Sometimes, you might need the biologics to stop it if the inflammation is too great in your blood tests as you need to stop the damage. You can perhaps then wean off it with the help of diet.\u00a0\r\n\u200b2 months ago i was on a plane sat next to a girl who had a spinal tumour which had nearly paralysed her. It took her a yar to recover from the op. It then came back and was not malignant but as it grew pressed on her spinal cord. Thus something had to be done. Bravely, she refused the second op temporarily whilst going on a total exclusion diet. No sugar, wheat, dairy, alcohol.\u00a0 Over the last 6 months she and her surgeon have watched the tumour shrink - all confirmed by her hubbie who is high up in the armed forces, sat next to her. Not gone yet but can alost not see it and she can walk again.\u00a0\u00a0 Her belief was that sugar was the big issue as it feeds rogue cells, free radicals, tumours etc.\u00a0 She had a veggie salad but refused the dressing as it may contain sugar.\u00a0 Made me think and i;ve been very cautious about it ever since. She wasnt a nutter - just someone who was trying the best she could to help her body, but also under control of her surgeon, who was\u00a0keeping a beady eye on her situation.\u00a0\u00a0 I'd ask your rheumy and try and get them on your side as you try things. Some have long lost the scientific curiosity to\u00a0be interested in unusual cases but others will be fascinated by your endeavours and will work with you if you ask them to. \u00a0Try and find the latter rheumy who will come up with a plan to help you not get damaged whilst you try things out and can wean you off things but also know if you really do need e.g. a biologic for a period of time to stop damage.\r\n\u200bOut of curiosity\u00a0is your LDL level\u00a0raised?\u00a0\u00a0",

However, in those with a weak immune system, it can cause hepatitis etc etc. Its realy important to boost immune system but i am sure they are already treating you for this stuff... if your immune system weakens, it can reactivate the virus in those who are susceptible.\u00a0 Its also really important to get advice on pregnancy etc.\u00a0\u00a0 You seem quite knowledgeable about it all so it sounds like the doctors are on the case of treating you...\r\n\u200bYour combination of things is really quite unusual ... hepatitis induced arthritis is not that common and can spontaneously resolve but can remain prolonged in some patients... Hep antigens are normally present after 2 weeks & joint symptoms start within 12 weeks normally...\r\n\u200bhow long have you had and are you under constant care now? How often are you going back etc? What have they said? I think i;d rely on the medics on these issues as very few people on this board will have this issue. It is well researched and of interest to the medics who have on-going research.\u00a0 Presume given the Int Care Unit involvement you are under the care of a teaching hospital and their rheumatology dept. They may be able to put you in touch with others with these issues. Failing that contact Arthritis UK who may be able to as well as i think very few on this board would be able to understand first hand what you are going through.\u00a0 It can resolve but it is fundamental to boost your immune system so the original virus does not reactivate.\u00a0\u00a0 I would think the medics have explained this and the drugs you are on are probably in part doing this.\r\n\u200bWhere abouts in country are you and i will see if i can find a support group for you - am at a meeting tomorrow with some top Rheumatologists in UK and will ask how to go about this for you....\r\n\u200bMake sure you have asked your rheumy how to boost your immune system and ask to be referred to a dietician to give you all the help you can to eat the right stuff to do so.\u00a0 One of the issues is that normally the medics will want to suppress the immune system to get rid of inflammation but they will hesitate to do so in this instance as normally it takes hold due to an already weakened imune system. Go back and say you are in pain and very worried and could someone spend a few minutes with you to explain all the ins the outs and come up with a plan for your overall health.\u00a0 If its helpful i will ask tomorrow the questions you might ask.\r\n\u200bSOme do spontaneously resolve so in order to feel a bit more in control and to give yourself the best chance go for an immune boosting diet ASAP and start to write a list of questions you need to ask your rheumy.\u00a0 Research it on John Hopkins website or Mayo Clinic web sites and dont hesitate to call Arthritis UK Register on the John Hopkins site and they will send you updates regularly on all types of arthritis - occasionally they share the latest stuf on what you have so this will give you a bit of hope... lots of research being done - but i would think best things are as above.\r\nI do understand why you feel alone in this - need to find you some other people in same boat and it is quite unusual. Dont give up yet - start to take control; make sure you understand it fully and make sure you are on optimal diet to boost immune system.\u00a0\u00a0 It does sound to me like the current med team are your best bet for a lot of answers as hepatitis induced arthritis varies from one person to next and is so serious i woudl not necessarily take much in from these boards. HOwever, in all cases linked to low immune system... so talk to the dietician at the hospital on whats best for you\u00a0 - ignore mst diet advice on these boards as unless poeple are really in the know, most exclusion and 'healthy' diets might be contra-indicated given the drugs you will be on.\u00a0 Ask the Rheumy to let you see dietician then at least you are working with them to try and build up your system again. Hope this is helpful Take care and try not to worry for the minute as some do resolve as the immune system builds back up. You have 2 underlying issues though - the rare reaction to the initial virus and the hepatitis. Thus best thing is to love your med team and ask them for more help in understanding it all.",

If it was me, then i think you shudl be asked to be referred to a top hand surgeon. Dont panic!\u00a0 THe best surgeons in my experience will NOT want to operate but they tend to be attached to very good hand therapists and will also be able to be much more informed on what is going on in the joint.\u00a0 You may need better splints; you may need to go on stronger drugs to halt the inflammation to protect the joint. The injection may help but i would not have one personalyl until i;d seen a really good surgeon.\u00a0 Voltarol will be better than ibuprofen to rub on it a nly 5% gets to the tummy compard to taking oral tablets.\u00a0 GO on a non-inflammatry diet and make sure you are eating tons of veggies and anti-oxidants - i mean tons e.g. 7 veggies a day, lots of greens... buy a decent veggie cook book to try and encourage yourself. You need to give your wrist all the help it needs to stop the damage by eating the right vits to give it every chance of healing. Cut out wheat, dairy, alcohol, red meat. Lots of fruit and veg and fish.\r\n\u200bYou will not get better unless inflammation is cut down.\u00a0 a good hand therapist might also use ultrasound to try and lower teh inflammation. Where do you live?\u00a0 You need the advice of a good hand surgeon.\u00a0 If anywhere near Berkshire, try Chris Khoo. Super guy. He'll give you solid advice.\u00a0\u00a0 The injection is to lower inflammation but i would do everything in my power to lower it before having one.\r\n\u200bWarmth in morning brings blood to the joint to try and heal it. Ice at nighttime means the blood will flow away from joint, taking crap with it. Try everything - diet, splints, ice, voltarol, hand surgeon advice. THey are all first port of call. I;d also ask Rheumatologist if you shoudl be on antibiotics to try and clear the original infection but its probably long gone and has left ongoign inflammation in the joint. If you fell you;ve tried all that, then the injection might work - personally i'd do the above first and always get 2nd opinion on injection.\u00a0\r\n\u200bHope this helps",

I am suffering reactive arthritis for 10 years and it gets better but can come back. I always have it but no where near as intense. when I was able to excercise and lift weights again I got better but never cured. I\u00a0 injured my wrists from boxing.\u00a0 I had sore wrists from heavy impact and the pain lasted 6 months atleast. before that I was punching the bag and never had problems. This Reactive arthritis seems to attack whatever it wants too for some reasons I do not know but I obviously punched the heavy bag to hard and it caused flare-up. I was just drying my hair and my neck went stiff and stuff. Try not to provoke it but keep on moving or excercising without making yourself worse. Sometimes you just might flare up for no good reason, so try not to get upset about it. It will make you worse being stressed. My right wrist now clicks. Its very wierd but symptoms for me have always changed and gotten better. My lower back was the worste for 2 years. I couldnt bloody sit down , it was hell and nobody understood. So if you can find a very good rhumy and hand speacialist. Sparkle answered everything very well but make sure if you get injection go to a good doctor to do the procedure. I was scared as hell but went well. I felt better within 3 days. I am probably getting another in 2 months because it worked so well. Try to avoid injections though if you can with oral medications. Go to a good rhuematologist. different antiinflamatories work for different people. If you get stomach ulcer go back to doctor. Also make sure you do the blood tests because anti inflamatories can have side effects. Good luck and I never knew people in the same state were dealing with this. Go to moore park PRP imaging for injection. Hes bloody good and all the surgeons next door. I think its cause they do footballers so they get the best. I noticed very good doctors in the north or heart of syd. Do get second opinions.",

Some treatments may take a few weeks to notice results. I have noticed if I rest the joint as much as possible from movements that irritate it. But sometimes everything can irritate it then thats when anti inflamatories help. Hope this helps but sometimes time will heal best. Symptoms will just go away or ease so in the back of my mind I know I will eventually get better from my current symptom hopefully. I have frozen shoulder from dislocating shoulder for 6 months now( lost mobilty and have pain) . Reactive arthritis has begun again, so I got injection and antiinflamatories. I might go get some accupuncture this week. See if it helps. SO just try different things. My pockets seem to be empty when I get flare-ups from all the treatments. be careful of people making you worse. Dont do anything your not comfortable with because a physiotherapist pushed on my spine. It flared up in my spine. Thats when I got real bad and couldnt sit down. It jumped down my neeck into my lower back like an explosion. I instantly couldnt sit down for years and was hell. I had pain pretty much everywhere as well but the lower back was so bad it sent pain into my stomache. My organs were all inflamed including diaphram/chest. the symptoms were endless but I got better. my symptoms are less severe that is sure",

I found it hard to cope cause I couldnt sit, everybody seems to have something that bothers them in one or 2 specific areas at a time. So hopefully your wrists will improve over time but I totally understand your difficulties because you cut hair and need your wrists. Try meditation or mindfulness techniques if it really gets tough. It sounds stupid but we become very sensitive from our illness sometimes. So meditation can really help because we have become so sensitive. It could help relax all your musclles too and improve mind. They honestly could help because there is actual evidence on these techniques helping. The problem is that meditation needs to be done everyday for atleast 20 mins. even if you start thinking about other things and then refocus to your breathe. It will train you. Now the benefits of meditiation go beyond our illnesses and improve our mind health. Mind and body are connected. You need something to take away the inflamation.\u00a0 It took me another couple of years to improve with excercise and being more active with anti inflamatories/accupuncture. Anything that reduces nflamation to get me moving with minimal pain.\u00a0\u00a0 you can only do a certain amount oif injections in a year i believe.\u00a0 My muscles just won\u2019t relax from the dislocation. The injection really did work well, I was scared also that I was going to react to injection.\r\n\r\n\u00a0I got stomach ulcers like yourself from naproxen. Did your stomach ulcers feel like a washing machine and pain in stomach?. I have never really taken ipburophen just panadol for headaches. For some reason panadols always stop my headaches that come from my neck but I try to not take them too much. Make sure you drink enough water too. I get dehydrated easily now and sometimes my underarms are itchy so try different deodorants. There are chemicals in that crap that effect my skin. I really do hope diet can help you. I am going to a dietition to get food elimination diet too.\r\n\r\nChronic fatigue was very dangerous for me at one point driving. So dont drive when you get this tired please. I would get so tired for 1 hour everyday at about 2 o clock for 3 months. I dont get it anymore. It is very strange and difficult to deal with. I was at work and fell a sleep in front of my computer. I thought it might have been food. Do you get a metallic taste in mouth? I sometimes have had this"

I work as a chef and noticed a bug t of pain in my right knee, then my left. I thought it to be normal wear and tear from sixteen years of athletics \u00a0and followed by another sixteen years of cooking on my feet all day.\r\n\r\ni worked through excruciating pain for three weeks until I just couldn't any more. This is when the search for diagnoses/ treatment started. I started this with no problems nsurance. First went to ER: took x-rays, nothing wrong gave me some pain pills sent me home.\r\ni thought extra days of rest work led help and I'd be back to work within the week. Pain got worse even with rest and have not been able to work for the last 2 months.\r\n\r\ni went to a knee specialist thinking there had to be something physically wrong with my knees.they did a quick physical and ultra sound. Again saw nothing wrong, expressed extreme concern thought could be neurological or Rhuematological.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo so my knees had nothing physically wrong, great! But I could barely walk and pain got worse every day.\r\n\r\nwaiting for my nsurance I went back to ER hoping to get some blood work. They said they couldn't help me and threw me out. Very discouraged and confused I didn't know what to do. Primary care put me on a waiting. In the mean time I went to an acupuncturist. He was surprised at my loud knees. My knees when bearing any weight creak and grind. Went to a physical therapist just to try to ease the pain. He was perplexed as well but recomended me to th Urgent Care.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI wasas able to go pay cash for an appointment. Doctor had no idea , and thought I was there for Pain pills. I said I just want to run blood tests. I had witnessed some scaly rash on cheeks and slight psoriasis on scalp. Thought maybe I had lupus or something. Next week I went back, blood work was all negative. I told him I had recently developed pain in my left testicle ( I suffered from a bout of epididymitis about four years back). I also remembered that before the knee pain started I had a large style under my lower eyelid. He\r\n\r\nhe brought up Reiters Diseaes. He put me on doxycycline and some pain mess. The testicular pain cleared up but knee pain persisted. NO Swelling or inflammation, just every type of pain imaginable.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI finally received insurance through the state and was able to get into a primate Doctor. She also brought up Reiters, put me on Indomethacin. I'm he med had no effect and the pain got worse. I went back and now am on prednisone. Only a day later my testified liar pain has returned and am again extremely worried. I have an appointment with a rheumatologist but not until June 23. I have yet to receive a definite diagnosis and am extremely confused as I read through possible causes: reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme disease, or whatever else. The worst part is not knowing.",

Once I got diagnosed, I started taking action with my diet. I took a blood test to figure out my food sensitivities and I went hard core on not eating anything I was sensitive to. It was not easy because I had a lot of sensitivities. I also started on meditation tapes. This was because I noticed my symptoms flared when I was very stressed. I got better for a long time and every once in a while I would have a mini flare that was mild and quick so I never even took anything. \r\n\r\nThen last month a very close family member was diagnosed and died from a terminal illness. I was shaken and have had a huge flare-up. Walking hurts and my spine. I am seeing my rheumatologist to talk about Humira. It is a biologic drug. \r\n\r\nI understand what you mean about the pain. It is very hard to deal with when it is bad and hard to stay consistent and up for your kids. I hope that you find a good med with your doctor soon. I know for me it is a combination of meds, diet and working on relieving stress. I have seen the direct correlation between stress and my symptoms getting much worse. \r\n\r\nSorry for your suffering. None of us should have to live with this. \r\n\r\nKate",

Many people have dreadful things to live with and I always told myself it's mainly pain and it will not kill me. Try to stay positive, it will go and yes it is hell but you will get through it. Make sure you get to see a sympathetic doctor who prescribes whatever you need and keep trying different drugs if others don't work. You will get better. There are lots of us out here and we do get through it sooner or later. Good luck and stay strong.",

            "post": "Dear doctors,\r\n\r\nI have been suffering from what started as a sacrum pain in the right lower back, since two years ago,\u00a0strangely, after an insect bite. Initially I had 1 episode of red bloody stools which disappeared and the pain went into remission. Pain flared up again and became worse upon the taking of caffeine and chilli.\u00a0A GP\u00a0prescribed Arcoxia with a few days of relief but strangely pain spread to leg after taking of inflammatory Arcoxia, Pain seems to be chronic. RA test showed no signs of arthritis, just raised ESR level of 27/20. One day, GP prescribed papain for relief of sorethroat and strangely, pain spread to left sacrum and spinal chord, tests showed ESR level had increased to 47. Separately, yet potentially relatedly, gardnerella virus was found during a pap smear and antibiotics was prescribed by my gynae. Flagyl (both oral and insert) was used, pain was decreased however, pain flared up again after a jungle trekking session. - It is not known whether the gardnerella virus was the cause of the inflammation or whether the antibiotics helped merely because of its inflammatory properties. ESR level remained high at 42 after treatment with flagyl. Normal results for cell blood count tests and other inflammatory markers. Having been a person involved in competitive sports since young and very familiar with sport injuries (e.g. gymnastics) but never having hurt the back before. from my viewpoint the pain experienced is a biting and dull, numbing pain, unlike any sporting injury like ache, tear, sprain, fracture. And back pain was sustained at a time of inactivity. No sports, no exercise during that period when this peculiar pain was sustained.\r\n\r\nX-rays were done with normal results, no inflammation of the spine, and sacral bones were shown. MRI not done yet, but might be next step, pending specialist's advice. Specialist initial diagnosis was mechanical pain, however original GP advised not to pass off back, sacral, hip, pelvic pain as mechanical. Please advise.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

I recovered from the food\r\n\r\n\r\npoisoning within 4 days, and a week later, I could barely get out of bed.\r\nI spent \u00a3400 on a 30minute visit to a specialist, who confirmed RA, and then gave me a cortisone jab, which made me better for 2 weeks, after which I took Ibuprofen 4 times a day, which kept me going, though I was so tired that I slept for an hour during the day. I had no energy, and blood tests showed that my whole system was up the creek. From the end of May, to the end of August, the condition caused me pain in my feet, knees and hands. Since then, there has been a gradual improvement, to the extent that I bought a moutain bike to help me get strength back in my legs, and I regularly go on long hill walks to get my feet working properly. I am almost back to normal, though my feet ache a little, and my energy is fine. I am a 67 yr old, and damaged my foot climbing, my knee skiing, and my hand with a thorn prick, which caused it to swell up,(over a year ago). I was attacked in these areas only.\u00a0",

I was about to go on Humira, one of the biologic drugs, and it got better. I was good for a few months and then it flared up again and I got very discouraged. Started looking at Humira again. Then it got better again. \r\n\r\nI used to be terrified of the biologic drugs but not any longer. I feel that if needed to control symptoms, then it is good they are out there. For me, I changed my diet. I have almost no gluten and I try to stay away from anything that can cause inflammation. I eat a lot of whole foods now and drink Kombucha, which is a probiotic drink, every day. I also know for me that stress plays a huge role so I try to keep that in control. \r\n\r\nI did do a blood test to see what foods I am sensitive to. I tried to cover all of my bases. I am good now and once in a while my left knee is cranky and I can feel like a mini flare up coming on but it goes away. \r\n\r\nI have HLA B27 too. My rheumatologist tells me this is the best of all the rheum conditions to have because it is easier to go into remission. \r\n\r\nYou can try to remove gluten or inflammatory foods in your diet and see how that goes. I was also working with a woman who had this condition for years and cured herself through using a combination of diet (eliminating food sensitivities) and a certain type of meditation. I believe in the mind body connection more than ever and even though we have this annoying gene there are things we can do. My aim is to get this into remission for good. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you are doing. I know how upsetting this is when you are normally an active person. It will get better, however. There are options out there. ",

I suffered for a year, and I mean suffered with it spreading from my knees to my spine. I changed my diet, eliminated gluten. Did an ALCAT blood test to find out my food sensitivities and really went nuts removing everything that showed up as a food sensitivity. Started meditating to reduce stress. Went on sulfasalazine for 6 months which did not work. \r\n\r\nA few months ago it suddenly got better. Not perfect but so much better I was pretty happy and could have lived with the few aches and pains in my legs and knees. Symptoms were very mild and I felt close to being back to my old self. \r\n\r\nHaving had a stressful September, symptoms started back up again a couple of weeks ago and I have been miserable again. Low quality of life. I got strict again on my diet and trying to reduce stress or handle it better. I am really discouraged though. I thought I had it managed and I never would get a bad flare up like this again. It shocked me. \r\n\r\nNow I am trying to find my way back again. I went from so hopeful to worried and I want to get back again to where you are, Clara, and stay there. \r\n\r\nThere has got to be a solution to this. I know that everyone here has triggers and these are probably individual and unique unto ourselves. However I believe there must be a way to keep this in check so that we can all live good lives and not suffer greatly from this condition. Whether that be meds, diet, stress reduction, whatever it could be. \r\n\r\nJust last month I was ready to write in to help someone w diet control because of how well I felt.

I got the condition after having gastroenteritis for a week starting 11th June, after a couple of days I went back to work not 100% but well enough and noticed 3 days later that my knee had swollen up to a crazy size and was causing me untold pain. On the evening of the 18th I went to hospital and they straight away diagnosed it as reactive arthritis and drained my 3 times to test if it was infected (it wasn't). I stayed in hospital over night and they put me on diclofenac, pain killers and some stuff for my tummy which still wasn't right sent me on my way informing me all would be fine after a week of rest. I wasn't fine a week later and in fact was much worse with my feet swelling up and my right elbow and fingers. I went to my gp after days of crazy pain sometimes barely able to move or get out of bed he sent me to rheumatologist on the NHS that appointment was months away so to speed up process I decided to go private for an appointment to see what they would say. Straight away they took me off the diclofenac and put me on 20mg of prednisolone (4 tablets, steroids I believe) It was then the weekend and I was in untold pain with not being able to move and joints swelling up I went straight back to the rheumatologist after the weekend and they doubled my dose 40mg and added 2 tablets of sulfasalazine a day. This has helped, the pain is still there but no where near the extremes of what it was.\r\n\r\nWhile all of this has been going on I have been booking an appointment with my gp every other week to keep him in the loop. I have had many blood tests that both my gp and rheumatologist look at and decide the next course of action. Reading stories id say that I am in the middle bracket of how serious my reactive arthritis is with the amount of pain but I feel that this may be because I have reacted quickly to each individual new symptom. I am also going physio on a weekly basis and as soon as I feel strong enough have been told to go swimming. I have lost a lot of muscle and strength due to not doing any real activity for a month which I feel is making me feel worse.\r\n\r\nNow I am a month in and like everyone I guess we are all being told you will get better within 3-12 months. Also like everyone I have goodish days and terrible days I have lost my active lifestyle at the moment, I cant work and even going out to meet friends is a chore and have to call it a night early. I am not an idiot I no it will take time and I have had some very dark days in the last month where I have just thought what is the point this disease is to strong for me. I cant say 100% that i'll play football again like I did and be able to do everything at work like I use to, but I'm going to keep trying as you have to believe what the doctors are telling you.      \r\n\r\nIf people are interested of how I get along who are in same position I will keep posting on here to update and hopefully will improve for us all!!

I do as much exercise as possible walking to the shops and swimming but as yet still unable to return to work as an outdoor activity instructor. \r\nYou are a lot further along than I am but from what I hear its a long term thing and you can have good days/weeks and bad days/weeks as im sure you have found out. Stay strong and I really recommend swimming as I started feeling better and stronger when I started doing this twice a week. ",

I would love to share the whole story but in the US u have to restrict yourself a bit when you are in the middle of your medical process.\r\n\r\nIt has been a month, two bouts of steroids and a trip to the ER so far. According to a ton of tests I am clean as a whistle... Days of emotional despair and feeling absolutely terrified about the future are mixed with tiny hope from other peoples experiences.\r\n\r\nI hope you are feeling better and that you continue to share your stubbornly positive outlook. I am an absolutely positive kind of person who truly believes that all matters of worry will work themselves out in the end, but this is hard to exist with. At least I can walk again. For now. \r\nWishing you a bunch of good days ",

I started feeling extraordinary pain located in my back, left side, around my kidney, along with some right knee swelling. I obviously had no idea what was this about. I got to he hospital and, and then derived to the rheumatologist. After tons of tests, all doctors could be sure of is that swelling was taking place. No rheumatoid factor, no HLA positive, no anything. Just guessings about an urinary infection as a trigger for what happened next.\r\n\r\nSo I began to take the so familiar bunch of pills, prednisone at first, sulfasalazyne joining later. I must say, the back pain almost kept me from walking, felt like being rigid as a stick. Before prednisone came to my life, I was infiltrated with intralumbar Inzitan injections, 6 in a row, 1 per week. Back pain vanished. Right knee swelling remained.\r\n\r\nFor a month I could not walk unless I was on crutches, then I began walking on my own. I have never taken more than 12.5 mg prednisone and 3000 mg sulfasalazyne a day. I currently take only 2.5 mg prednisone and 3000 mg sulf. that is 6 tablets (though I feel its combined effect as mostly useless) along with ibuprofen (600 mg, once a day, only when needed, I mean, when morning stiffness gets quite unbearable).\u00a0\r\n\r\nI must admit I enjoy a near-to-normal life. I walk my dogs, I'm able to go to work on my own, I can take the car... Well, you know. But it doesn't receed at all. You all know how this curse behaves, some days gets worst, some others gets better, bu never actually good. I miss my knee as it was almost one year ago. I miss riding my bike, I miss mountaneering, I miss my outdoor life which I often fear to never come back.\r\n\r\nHowever, something quite interesting is happening lately: bad times are becoming sparser and quite not so intense, while good times are increasing, both in time lasting as in intensity. Not as noticeable as I wish, but it could be a start. I really wish it is.\r\n\r\nSo I want to think ther is light at the end of the tunnel. I just wanted to let all you know how I'm going through this condition. Hope it helps.\r\n\r\nNever give up!\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

My rhuematologist\u00a0said that it was\u00a0due to\u00a0an Epstein Barr Virus and Parvovirus test that came back positive. My symptoms started out with severe muscle spasms in\u00a0my neck,\u00a0that caused me to have vertigo, and I had several steroid injections in my C-spine that did not help. My spine is deteriorating\u00a0and I have\u00a0several bulging discs in my C and\u00a0T spine, along with my lumbar spine,\u00a0that cause frequent pain. I have had swelling of the knees off and on which would switch from one knee to the other, and almost daily now in my lower\u00a0back and down the back of my legs. I am tired all of the time and\u00a0I usually sleep most of the day. I am also vitamin D defficient which I take supplements for everyday. My Rheumatologist put me on meloxicam that I cannot take due to stomach problems. I found out that I have chronic gastritis and stomach ulcers when I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done\u00a0before I had surgery to take my gallbladder out in February 2014. The colonoscopy was done because of a CT scan that showed I had a case of acute colitis and my gallbladder was taken because it just quit functioning. I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced any of these problems and if they could all be due to\u00a0Reactive Artritis? And if anyone else developed Reactive\u00a0Artritis due to being rexposed to the Epstein Barr Virus and Parvovirus. I have been in extreme pain lately with this horrible disease and I am just looking for some input to help ease my symptoms. Thank you",

Upon getting better my dodgy left knee became acutely and very painfully inflamed. After a week of agony and immobility and a couple of knee syringes I was taken into hospital for an operation on my knee to relieve the inflammation.\r\nI then started to develop severe stiffness in my neck, rib cage, back generally and curiously on the insides of my legs at the top?\r\nI was diagnosed with reactive arthritis and prescribed diclofenac 50mg three times a day.\r\nAfter nearly 6 months my pain is still chronic especially if I miss a dose of diclofenac and my knee has swollen up again. I also have pain in my left foot and one toe!\r\nmy sympathies go out to all those suffering from this unpleasant and painful condition. Pain killers tend to have different effects on different people so dont give up if one doesnt work, keep pestering your GP for alternatives. Personally Diclofenac controls my pain with an occassional cocodamol 8/500 (available OTC) but it has and I guess will, take a long time to resolve. I think 12 months can be considered \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.\r\nIt certainly affects your personal life in terms of activity but have found that getting back on my bike helps my joints and certainly helps my sanity. Cycling is also \\&quot;low impact\\&quot; on the knee joint.\r\nSome NSAIDs do not irritate the stomach as much as others and you can be prescribed another drug at the same time called a PPI such as Omeprazole which will helps to prevent this side effect.\r\nOral steroids can be helpful to reduce \\&quot;flare ups\\&quot; but should be carefully monitored, Steroid injections can help in specific joints and may last for several months.\r\nMethotrexate is a strong drug used mainly in RA but can be effective if the problem is chronic and I know 2 people who have a seriously improved quality of life on this drug.\r\nAs it probably auto-immune ie its your own immune system causing the problem it will difficult to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; . However time does seem to improve the situation.\r\nHope this info helps.",

I'm off naproxen (stared with ibuprofen which worthless) but it can give you heart problems and I don't want that. I had blood test, D vit and B12 low level, I'm taking the vitamins now, went to osteopath who demands a second blood test (I'll go there tomorrow) to check my HLA B27 level, which could refer to these illnessess. Now mainly my sacroileitis is painful but it also radiates and sometimes my arms get swollen, my hands and the venues puffed up like they gonna pop out.

I eventually managed to reach my phone which was at the side of my bed and called my flat mate. With him holding the phone to my face I called the University doctors but as it was the weekend it was shut. I called the NHS helpline. They told me to take Nurofen. I stressed that I could hardly move but they seemed to think I was being a hypochondriac. I asked if they would be able to send a doctor out to me and they refused. I then called my parents who live about an hour away from my University in Nottingham. They came straight away and slowly managed to get me into the car. \r\nI got home and was in terrible pain all over; I also had a couple of little red spots on my fingers. The pain was so bad that I couldn\u2019t even sit up in bed or get to the bathroom on my own. My mum spent ages on the phone to the NHS helpline who advised her this time to call an ambulance. She told mum it looked like meningitis. The ambulance arrived. The paramedic took my temperature and looked at the rash. He said it was a virus and would be gone in a couple of days then left. I was seen by my family doctor on Monday after the symptoms were no better. He examined me and took blood tests. The results showed that I had massive inflammation. The pain stared to settle in three areas. My left hand/wrist, my left foot/ankle and my right shoulder. The doctor said the blood tests showed what looked like arthritis and he wanted to book me into the hospital. I was on a very high dose of steroids which were helping slightly but were never going to be a long term solution. At this point it had been about 6 weeks since the pain started. The Hospital appointment came and they could not see me for another month. I decided to go private. \r\nThe doctor saw me a week later. He examined me and found that my heart was beating at around 140 beats per min. he was really concerned by this and wanted me in hospital the next day. At this point I still could not walk or lift anything heavy. \r\nThe next day I was admitted into hospital, this was also the day of my 19th birthday. They sent me for an emergency heart echo which showed nothing abnormal, my heart started to slow down a little and they put it down to being under stress and in pain. \r\nI was poked and prodded and tested for every possible thing. After a week I was diagnosed with reactive arthritis and things at last started to become clear. The little symptoms like flaky skin on my hands and feet made sense and the sore eyes. \r\nI saw a physio therapist who taught me exercises and got me taking my first steps in 8 weeks. I felt like Bamby. It was still very painful and the doctors decided to give me steroid injections into my joints. \r\nThey said I could go home as soon as I could walk on my own so after 3 days and allot of hard work and tears I was discharged. Being in hospital was having a terrible effect on my mental health. I was becoming increasingly low and my family had begun to worry so being discharged was a great relief.\r\nI planed to be back at university after the 3 week Easter brake. I missed university so much and couldn\u2019t wait to be back. I did everything in my power to get better quicker. I was being weaned off the steroids and I was walking as much as I could every day. \r\nI made it back for the fist day of summer term. Looking back a was still very poorly but very determined. I was walking very slowly and yes it was very painful but as far as I was concerned I was out of a wheel chair and doing it alone. My shoulder was almost totally recovered. It clicked and ached slightly but nothing to complain about. My wrist was still a big problem; I needed help with things like opening jars or tins.\r\nSo now its 2008 and it will be two years in February since I was diagnosed. If you met me now you would know I had anything wrong with me but I still have bad days. I ride my bike and my wrist will hurt the next day. I wear heals and I might spend the next day limping. I have managed to get to the point where I can get on my tip toes and my grip in my left hand is ok now. I cant bend my left wrist back very far and I still have some swelling across my left knuckles. The joints which were effected are very clicky and girindy. \r\nI wondered if any one has had a similar experience and how there recovery has ended up. I have come to the grim conclusion that I may always be in some pain. It doesn\u2019t really affect my life that much. I am going travelling around south America next year and I lead quite an active life.\r\nDoes anyone have any advice or any stories? I wondered if anyone else took longer than this to heal after an extreme case?\r\n\r\nP.S sorry for the length but I wanted to express what a struggle I\u2019ve had so others can maybe take something from it if all seems hopeless. I was at an all time low in my life and I am now at a stage where I can look back and feel I have come out the other side with almost all my health back. Thanks for any responses.",

                    "post": "Hello CarlyDate1944,\r\nI'm sorry to hear that you've had such an awful experience, it sounds excruciating. But I can completely relate to you, I\u2019m 27 and have never had any problems with my joints before but following couple of throat infections during the course of 2007 I have developed some stiffness in all my joints, which to be honest didn't concern me that much. I have always put it down to spending too much time in front of the computer. \r\nAbout three months ago however, I've developed some other symptoms such as flare-ups in my wrists and knuckles and stiffness in my lower back along with symptoms of Reiter\u2019s Syndrome so my GP has suspected REA straight away and this was confirmed after couple of tests. I was given a three week course of antibiotics and a prescription for Ibuprofen and was truly hoping that once the antibiotics kick in all will clear up and I\u2019ll be back to my normal self. The antibiotics have cleared up the RS symptoms only for a few days after which I was beginning to suffer with my joints and the RS symptoms as well. This was the second attack that I had and the Ibuprofen had still worked but when I had my third attack that I have at the moment, I can take as many pills as I like but still cannot relieve the discomfort and pain. \r\nAll my joints seem to be affected now beginning with finger knuckles to my ankles and toes, my lower back hurts but my knees and especially my hips are the worst. The pain feels like an intensive stabbing tooth-ache in each joint. My joints however do not even appear swollen and I don\u2019t have a rush either but I have never experienced a pain like this before and hope once it gets better I never will again. It paralyses me, the painkillers upset my stomach and I\u2019m quite down as I can\u2019t keep up with Uni assignments. I have found herbal mobility gels (Verde) helpful to some extent as they numb the joint area or hot baths also, but the relief is usually short lived. Just like you I have also experienced heart palpitations and chest pains and one of my knuckles already seems to be permanently affected as it keeps locking and is painful to touch.\r\n CarlyDate, I truly hope that neither you nor I will have to go through this ever again. \r\nAll the best.  \r\nJ.B.",

                    "post": "I've had a couple of fare ups in the last 3 years, I'm 29 now. It started with umbarable pain in my wrist, that had been coming on slowly for a couple of weeks and then all of a sudden I was completely unable to even hold any of my tools at work and the pain was horrible. I went straight to A&E where they thought I could of possibly fractured my wrist but without any recollection of injuring it they were sure. I was given a wrist support and come codeine. After visiting the doctor because I was still in a lot of pain they concluded that it was tendinitis. I was given tramadol and had a week or so off work. It took a long time to sort itself out and going pack to work was really hard, at the time I was making bronze sculptures, which was very hands on and involved heavy lifting. I taught myself to use my other hand. Eventually I got the sack because of it. After having some further tests, x-rays and MRI scans they informed it there had been some bone damage in my wrist . It was a couple of months after this, shortly after starting a new job that i got up to go in to work and was pretty much completely unable to walk, my right knee wouldn't bend at all and putting any weight on it really hurt. After visiting the doctors the next day (a ten minute walk that took about 30minutes with a make shift crutch and my girlfriend helping my walk) the term relative arthritis started popping up, I was given some pretty brutal pain killers, had a blood test and a referral was she to someone at my local hospital. The following week I got a worrying call from the doctors as my blood test had come back with some worryingly high infection, which scared the crap out of me. So I was put onto weekly blood tests, liquid morphine for the pain and told to completely rest my leg. I think I had to wait for 3 months until I saw someone at the hospital. In this time is had gone down a bit and me being an idiot went straight back to work and my leg swelled up twice the normal size and I was getting stabbing pains in the back of my knee and calve muscle. I went back to A&E as everytime I tried to move it felt like something was going to explode in my leg. Which was very embracacing working in retail and being on the shop floor while this happened. At A&E they told me it was either a blood clot of something call a Baker's cyst. After having to horrible blood thinning injections while blood test results came back and having an ultrasound of my leg, I was told it was just the cyst and told more rest and more painkillers and if I didn't it could possibly rupture. When I finally saw a specialist at the hospital he told me more about reactive arthritis and some links were made with some eye problems I had as a child. When I was about. 12 years old I spent sometime in great ormonds street hospital after my right eye had become swollen and looked like it was about to pop out of my head. At first they thought I had a brain tumor but then after seeing lots of different doctors I was told I had an orbital pseudo tumor (now more normally refered to as orbital inflammation) After a course of steriod treatment this went back to normal but I occasionally have a flare up of iritis or the obitial inflammation now and again. So this was commonly linked with my joint problem. Apparently the problems if had with my eyes were basically arthritis of the eye. I think I was off of work for about 4 months in the end and it took a long time to sort itself out. Once everything had cleared up I was told about Sulpasalazine and started taking them although they did make me a bit sick to start off with. Everything has been absolutely fine since. Until now (hence why I'm looking back on these sites)\r\nI've been a bit of an idiot and completely stopped taking my sulphsalazine (on Boxing Day) I just got fed up with having to take 6 very hard to swallow pills everyday. I was always forgetting to take them and was told take of you miss them now and again they just don't work at all, so I didn't see the point and figured they probably didn't really help at all. I had been fine up until a few days ago, I'd noticed that I'd started getting mouth ulcers again (which is linked) and a few other linked problems. But I woke up a few days ago with a bad shoulder and elbow and just thought I'd slept on it funny or something but this morning it's gotten worse, with shooting pains between the elbow and should and extremely painful move. It's been a year and a half since the problems with my leg started. So I'm thankful I've had that time pain free but now I'm starting to feel like a bit of a dumbass for stopping my meds, I know that it's gonna be a long and painful next couple of months. I will go to the doctors tomorrow and stop being stubborn and I have a check up at the hospital booked for June. So I'll keep you all updated. Has anyone suffered from shoulder/elbow pain with this yet?\u00a0",

                    "post": "Hi CarlyDale1944\r\n\r\nThis seems like an old discussion so I hope by now that you have fully recovered from this very debilitating illness which you \u00a0have had particularly badly.\r\n\r\nMy story is here, although I feel somewhat bad in the telling of it as I did not suffer with ReA as badly as you, however I'd like to relate what happened and how I treated it in case there is someone else out there who can gain hope and relief from it.\r\n\r\nI came home from a holiday in The Gambia in April this year - felt fine until two days later when I went down with really bad diarrhoea which lasted over two weeks. I was very poorly with it and after three days went to my GP because I was concerned that I had picked up something nasty in The Gambia. \u00a0He tested for the most common five bugs but negative. \u00a0After this time I got a bad cold and \u00a0a very bad dose of conjunctivitis in one eye - then mouth ulcers. \u00a0I was given a short course of antibiotics for my eye. \u00a0I wasn't sure what was going on as I am normally fit and well and have never had health problems. \u00a0The next thing I knew I had fast growing and searing incredible pain in one knee - it came up in hours and my knee swelled up hugely. Then my other knee swelled up - I couldn't bend my knees, I don't know how I made it upstairs and I was screaming in pain. \u00a0What followed was weeks of this, I was barely able to get out of bed, unable to get into the shower unaided etc. \u00a0My right wrist swelled up, and latterly it got into my ribs; I \u00a0found sleep elusive and woke at 5am most days; it was less painful to be upright than lying down. \u00a0My GP diagnosed ReA- the bug had gone through my gut wall and into my joints and my body reacted by going into overdrive and producing massive inflammation. \u00a0I asked to be referred to a Consultant Rheumatologist who put me on Prednisalone - 20mg steroid. I lost all my energy and spent most of every day sleeping and the pain continued. \u00a0I have never known pain like it - and I have given birth to two children with no pain control! About this time I began researching on the internet for information. \u00a0I found very little available as it seems quite a rare condition, but I began to align it to Rheumatoid Arthritis which is far worse as it is not curable, but it is an auto-immune disease. In addition to the steroid I started taking large doses of Turmeric in tablet form (Curcumin) Healthspan sell a concentrated form of it, also Omega 3 fish oils, starflower oil, probiotics (Probio7), Solgar's Boswellia which contains frankincence, and Zyflamend - all these are anti inflammatory herbal medicines. \u00a0I also took a herbal diuretic as I was on steroids. \u00a0This coupled with regular acupuncture and \u00a0a very healthy diet of fruit, salads, vegetable and meat, fish and chicken etc. On a subsequent visit to my Rheumatologist after 11 weeks of this he suggested I went on Methatrexate. \u00a0I was amazed as I thought I was recovering so well considering he had told me it could last up to a year. \u00a0I politely refused and decided I would listen to my gut instinct that said my body was doing a very good job of healing without this nasty drug. \u00a0I asked instead for hydrotherapy which helped me no end. \u00a0 Now, I cannot say whether anyone reading this who is suffering with ReA should take all or any of this: clearly you should ask your GP and do your own research. I can say that just over three months later, I have the residue of the inflammation in my wrist, but for the most part I am almost back to normal. \u00a0I have some sort of 'adrenaline rush' every day, several times a day which isn't very pleasant and I think its the steroids - I am now down to 2mg a day and decreasing weekly. \u00a0I hope to be off them at the end of next week. Clearly I am unable to say why I have recovered so quickly compared to so many others who are still suffering years later - my heart goes out to you - its such a painful, debilitating illness. It may have been the antibiotics that stopped the spread of it, or the steroids, or the herbals - or the acupuncture or everything who knows? \u00a0\r\n\r\nI wish you all a speedy recovery.[color=#333333]=0px\u25e2[/color]\u00a0\u00a0",

            "post": "Hi \r\nIm new to this site.\r\nIm 37, female with four children. In july of 2008 I started to get stiff swollen fingers in the mornings, then it progressed into my knees wrists, ankles, hips, neck and clavicle area. I also had conjunctivitis, mouth ulcers and Keratoderma blennorrhagica. I am in terrible pain most days, i was house bound for three months. I was then admitted into hospital, they aspirated my knees and injected steroids into them, also i was on an iv with steroids also. I am taking diahydracodiene, paracetamol and tramadol for pain relief, although these dont seem to affect the pain too much, just makes me feel sick. I am also taking Lansoprazole, Celexocib, methotrexate, folic acid and last week i started taking Salazopryin. I had to go back into hospital last week as all swelling and pain became significantly worse, my rheumy aspirated my knees and put me on an IV again, said i need to go back for an MRI of my knees, because most of the swelling isnt synovial fluid but because of damage to ligaments and tendons, then a camera inserted into my knee and possible further surgery. I am already having to have surgery on my hands as this disease has left them badly deformed.  I was initally told that it usually lasts for 3-6 months, or in worse cases upto a year. This has been going on for 10months now and doesn't seem to be getting any better, despite all the medications. Is there no end to it all. My life has changed so much over the last 10 months, there is so much i cant do anymore. My Rheumy says that test were rheumatoid negative, but because its so severe he is treating it as RA. Is the any light at the end of the tunnel. Any words of advice or comfort would be much appreciated. Thankyou.",

I have been through the same hell as everyone else     taking bucket loads of drugs, sulfazaline and methotrexate didnt work for me, I took a malaria drug and          steroids ( injections and tablets) as well as all of the usual prescription painkillers. I was unable to do anything in so much pain  and joints swollen hugely.  95% of people get better after six months with little or no            permanent damage apparently.  The unlucky few like some of us on here take much longer. I am now off      most medication, just prescription  painkillers some days. I have been left with some damage to my knees,   major damage to both hips, which are both going to be replaced, and some minor problems in my hands. I     can do most things, with  limitations, walking any distance is a  problem, cant get up off the floor and              gardening is restricted to short bursts but on the whole things are pretty  good. I could not have imagined that I would be this good six years ago. Don't give up you will get a life back, probably not quite as  good as before before but pretty mobile and active and out of that dreadful all consuming pain. Would say it was three years before things started to really improve then gradual improvement since then.",

A very different story to last week when I was having to use sticks and having to do things very slowly with lots of rest.\r\nI have swollen ankles and knees but only my thumb on my left hand is affected at the moment. I have also noticed it seems to be much worse after doing a few extra things throughout the day. I am unable to take my dogs out or walk down to the shop and being stuck in the house unless my husband takes me is rather depressing. \r\nI hope your appointment with the specialist goes ok and you get the answers you need.\r\n\r\n  ",

Arrived back in the UK and returned home partially relieved for the normality albeit extremely cold.  a few days following my return I noticed a burning sensation in my urethra when I was passing urine, this was closesly followed by a grim case of the old red eye...superb!  I made an apointment to see my GP the following day, and woke the following morning with pain in my ankle but thought nothing of it as I put it down to chill pains that I have had in the past due to cold weather.  Anyway, I walked there in the snow, got prescribed some Trimethoprim for the UTI and some drops for my eyes although my ankle seemed to get more painful as the went on.  I returned home following collecting my precription, and took off my boot to find it was quite swollen.  Showed my wife, and we decided it was best to see the GP again so off we went..cut a long story short, was in hospital for 2 day, diagnosed with RA and was sent home with ibuprofen and paracetamol.  it has been about 5 days and in that time, my knee on the same leg, my jaw joint on the same side and my clavical joint on the opposite side (which I dislocated 6 years ago) have become inflamed.  I have been prescribed diclofenac 50mgs TDS, and am hoping things will improve.  The strangest thing though is that I have met in the short time of having the condition, 2 other people, women actually one of whom is younger who was diagnosed in August last year and is now working again, and another who was daignosed when she was 16 she had it in both knees and has made quite a good recovery.  The bottom line is this...  It seems that people do recover from this condition, so hey, I might too, I will Kepp you guys posted and will also let you know what I am doing.  Currently just taking Diclofenac 150mg daily, and also doing some light exercise on the joints, it does hurt, but hey no pain no gain right, and I firmly belive that it is keeping my joints at least slightly functional which has to be a good thing, dont plan on taking the diclofenac longer than a onth at this time, and will also be trying the grim vegetable juice drink described earlier.  Will let you know how I am getting on. Speak to you soon guys ;-)",

I got sores... down there. :-(\r\n\r\nLuckily, I'd already come across Reiters when researching Salmonella online, I suggested it to my Doctor, who tested me for HBA-27 (I think that the correct thing) and agreed.\r\n\r\nI've had courses of anti-biotics that cleared up all the other symptoms (thank god - no more sores... down there) and been on Diclofenac Pottassium for a couple of months while waiting for my referral to the Rheumatologist.\r\n\r\nMy symptoms got worse when they tried moving me to Tramadol (after some side effects from the Diclofenac) so I had an intra-muscular steroid injection... which worked wonders! Until it wore off a couple of weeks later, I'm better than I was though.\r\n\r\nI got moved onto Diclofenac Sodium, which helped, finally saw the specialist who put me onto Prednisalone (steroids) on a reducing dose, this was like a new lease of life!!!\r\n\r\nThe swelling around my ankles has gone, they feel almost nomal now. My knee still feels stiff if I walk or stand up for too long.\r\n\r\nMy dose is down to 15mg and sadly my feet are now getting worse. My index toes are swollen so much they dont bend and its getting hard to walk, do I go back to my doctor or wait 3 weeks for my next rheumatologist appt?\r\n\r\nI've had times when I felt quite down about it all. \r\n\r\nSadly my friends husband just got diagnosed with head and neck cancer - it all snapped into perspective for me.\r\n\r\nYes it sucks, yes I don't know when I'll be better... but it's not going to kill me.",

I managed about 20 lengths but luckily went with a friend as I found it hard getting in and out - in 6 weeks I was up to 100 lengths and feeling so much better.\r\n\r\n1 week before the swim, my doctor gave the ok, I think he was surprised at my progress in the previous month or so.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased to say I swam it in one go and raised around \u00a3450 for the Heart Foundation.\r\n\r\nMy joints have been mostly ok since, with just the odd twinge in my foot and ankle when its cold or I walk/run a bit too much.\r\n\r\nFor me, the removal of fluid from my joints and the steroid injections really were the turning point and having the swim to train for.\r\n\r\nI wish everyone all the best for 2009 - if you'd like to contact me, there's a link to my blog on my profile.",

(In case you were wondering it's been 20 months since my last flare up)\r\n\r\nFor me the fix was: fluid removed, steroids, vit B6+12 + swimming.",

I was wondering if you have learned what triggers your joint stiffness. Also do you take something to fortify your bones from prednisalone? I have also learned to take a long period of antibiotics, six months, has shown to help and in some cases eradicate ReA from the body. Have you heard of this? I am on a long treatment of antibiotics. I have noticed that the swelling on my ankle has come down a lot, but I am still having issues on my tendons, which have been the most affected. I also have some lumbar and cervical pain on my spine. I was wondering if you feel or felt some pain migrating in different parts of your body. I do.\r\nPlease check  and see if you can take some supplements such as vitamins D and calcium so you can counteract the side effects of prednisalone. How often to get a MRI on that knee, you should do it so you can see how your bones are doing there. Checking this avoids long term conditions or damages. Please keep us posted how you are doing. I am now following on twitter and on your facebook fan page. I think you have a great story to share. Keep up the good work. You are a true warrior, a true luchador.\r\n\r\nA big Hug!",

I do take a multivitamin most days, through process of elimination I worked out I needed more B vitamins.\r\n\r\nNot really my thing to take drugs generally, certainly I wouldn't want 6 months of antibiotics. My doctors don't really know much about ReA I don't think. Anyway, I cycle/swim/surf a lot n eat well so tend to avoid drugs unless I really need it! Never MRI'd my knee. \r\n\r\nCauses... hmmm I think mild food poisoning (the last flare up was at a festival) is the main one for me. The flare ups are really small compared to the first time, so once you're out of that it's fine.",

                    "post": "Hi Jason... very interested to hear your symptons and really do hope you are feeling better soon. I am 40, and on holiday in Florida, can you believe my honeymoon. Around 2 wks prior to going to Florida, i had been in Angola for 4 wks on a one off business trip. Whilst there i had terrible stomach/diarohea for 5-6 days. I was given Antibiotics, and thought that this would be the end of it. Well, when i got off the plane at Heathrow from Angola, i could hardly rise because of swollen coxacs pain, and i knew something just wasn't quite right. As time went by i developed burning sensation whilst urinating, and then i started to stiffen up at nights across my shoulders, arms, and was impossible to turn in bed, or even get up out of bed. I started to undergo some tests and tried to resume normal working patter,  but it was hard going. Anyway i felt better as the Florida vacation arrived, however, once arrived there, it took 3- 4 days, until my symptons returned with a vengeance, and i couldn't take any more, and i ended up in Hospital for 4 days. I had tremendous left flank pain, my shoulders were sore, my arm movement was minimal, my left foot swell up etc. Anyway i have been diagnosed with RA. I hope i will be able to shrug this off because I am a very ambitious person, and really like the whole buzz of life.... you should see the size of my garden i have to look after!!... oh no. I am now on very strong Antibiotics, and anti inflamatory tablets for my foot which is coming on fine. I still have long way to go though. My advice, go back to doctor, or get a second opinion, as I think you do have RA... Sorry!. I'm glad i got all my tests done in USA as they tested me for absolutely everything (ins job)....CAT Scan/ MRI Scan, X-Rays, Multi blood tests etc so had a very good MOT. Isn't it really frustrating when something hits you like bolt out of the blue.. i just keep saying to myself, it could be worse, a lot worse..... hope your better soon.

Results now in from the Doc and he extended the anti inflmation prescription and told me to rest.  Well, i was'nt vey happy about this as the meds were giving me jip (poorly tummy, irritable, falling asleep at 8.30 every night).  So, as i'm supposed to be taking part in the 24 Peaks challenge at the end of july i decided to do something about it myself.\r\n\r\nI went to see a slightly 'off the wall' osteopath who has instructed the following......its working too.\r\n\r\n- Stop taking meds\r\n- Osteo treatment each week\r\n- Epsom salts bath every night (1kg/bath)\r\n- Juice green veg each morning (1/2 iceburg lettuce, 1 geen pepper, 1 green apple, handfull of watercress and three red cabbage leaves....makes a pint....nice!!\r\n- cut out coffee\r\n- cut out processed food\r\n- light training only (try not to produce lactics)\r\n\r\nIdea is to enable the body to kick out the excess toxins which it is dumping in the joints.  Body is clever really as these toxins would cause serious problems if they got into major organs.\r\n\r\nThis method will not work over night but its natural and if you need bed rest initially thats the best way.  The meds only mask the problem and cause additional toxin buildup.....inflamation is a natural reaction allbeit painfull.\r\n\r\nWell, its working for me and i can be safe in the knowledge that i'm not filling my body full of chemicals.......i have to say that aside from the residual pain and some swelling, i really am starting to feel quite good.\r\n\r\nHope it all goes well for you and that you give the natural route a try.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJason",

I've been using it off &amp; on for the past 4  months ; however , at pretty small doses 1 x 16mg / day , 3 - 4 days at a time .\r\nMy RA isn't too bad so perhaps the dosing , that I adjusted myself ( trying to find the minimum effective value ) has been enough to help me .\r\n\r\nYou'll see in my posting that I make ref to another medication that I found on the Web as being a substitute to Prednisolone . I didn't yet get advise from the doc on that one , nor have I tried it . Not sure if its not one of those new bi-therapies that are so expensive that no GP will prescribe them !\r\n\r\nAnyway , see what you make of it .\r\n\r\nThks for any retun info you can give .\r\n\r\nAll the best  Kevin",
